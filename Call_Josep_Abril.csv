Abril,Computational Genomics Lab @ UB,Universitat de Barcelona,https://compgen.bio.ub.edu/,Computational genomics,Computational analysis of nanopore-sequencing metagenomic samples to discover and track potential pathogenic viral species.,"Metagenomics approaches based on high-throughput sequencing help us to characterize the microbe and viral communities on a wide variety of samples. They can be used as diagnostic tools to detect the presence of a known organism, which can be pathogenic or not, as well as to determine candidate novel sequences for previously unreported species (Martínez-Puchol et al, 2020; Rusiñol et al, 2020; Hjelmsø et al, 2017). Regarding the zoonotic phenomenon, it is known that bats are the origin of recent epidemics caused by Coronaviridae, like SARS and MERS genera, in human populations (Anthony et al. 2017). Several studies on viral diversity in bat feces/oral samples using metagenomics have provided better information than previous analyses using conventional molecular methods (Hardmeier et al, 2021; Lee et al, 2020; Donaldson et al, 2010).
Different methodologies can be used to obtain the samples that will be sequenced later on, each of them focusing on different facets of the genomes biology, but also implying different post-processing of the reads delivered by the sequencing technologies. Three main approaches can be considered: 1) whole-genome shotgun approaches, where the focus is to retrieve as many species genomes as possible and attempt to reconstruct the chromosomes, and run phylogenetic analyses to describe the taxonomic units (OTUs) composition; 2) targeted sequencing, based on enriching the samples for specific groups by using sets of proves designed to capture the sequences of interest, which can provide finer resolution to annotate variants or diverging sequences between species; 3) amplicon sequencing, where paired primer sequences delimiting a genomic segment facilitate the enrichment of that region by PCR amplification. In all those cases the resulting fragments (at read, contig, scaffold or chromosome level) can be used for phylogenetic analyses,
to characterize the species composition and to discover related novel species. The sequences can be also used to annotate allelic variants that can be relevant to understand the evolution of the viral species, as well as to assess the nucleotide positions that may have an impact at phenotypic level (single nucleotide variants or insertion/deletion events); which can result in increased/decreased transmissibility, antigenicity, or pathogenicity; all those having a role in disease severity, as it has been reported for SARS-Cov-2 (Callaway, 2020; Li et al, 2021; Harvey et al, 2021). The impact of the detected mutations on pathogenicity can be estimated on those sequences (Gussow et al, 2020); for instance, in order to predict if novel related species detected in human and animal samples have enough zoonotic potential to infect humans and become a source of novel pandemic events.
High-throughput sequencing on short reads can still provide insights of population variants of concern that may lead to the rise of novel lineages (Smyth et al, 2022), yet amplicon sequencing still poses some issues in the reconstruction of the phases of variants that fall outside overlapping fragments of tiled sets of amplicons, like those produced by the SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC set (Rambaut, 2020), as well as presenting some biases with the sampling of single nucleotide variants falling within the primers complementary genomic region
(Kuchinsk et al, 2022) and indels (Brandt et al, 2021). Long-read nanopore sequencing will pave the way to easily decipher allelic combinations that can result in better characterization of viral strains (Tyson et al, 2020). There are different approaches to take into account the higher error rates at nucleotide level still produced by nanopore sequencing that require deeper coverage to obtain reliable phasing clusters (Schrinner et al, 2020). Taking all of this in consideration, we must delineate how to process the sequences obtained from the ongoing research projects, and must look for solutions to address some of the already described issues that we found also in our sequencing data sets. This master project project will focus on the computational characterization of the genomic sequences of viral species that can be found on a variety of matrices, from wastewater to clinical samples.","Anthony S.J, et al. “PREDICT Consortium.
