Pathogenic fungi kill 1.5 million people per year. A major way they survive in hospitals and infect people is by sticking to to various biomaterials such as catheters, prostheses and medical implants. From there, replicate inside the body, causing systemic infection and, ultimatly, death.   Two lines of work from our lab ask: What are the genetic and non-genetic mechanisms that enable fungi to survive antifungals?  How do fungi evolve the ability to stick to various surfaces?   We are answering these questions using a mixture of mathematical modeling, experiments, and bioinformatics.   We will collaborate with Infections Diseases in the Hospital del Mar to test new methods for both treating and preventing infections.  		programming (any language)	Yes	Computational genomics	systems biology, single cell heterogeneity, transcription, DNA replication, comparative genomics	Yes		Single Cell Behavior					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnuf88dRc-veFa2oTZPlPNViLFf5gVHIlI1grdltrYuVaHIo77xsmHAQ9bA

However, it has not been used yet with to infer tumor phenotypes, and in particular, to infer therapeutic vulnerabilities. The use of multiple phenotypically characterised cell lines provides a unique opportunity to extract a wealth of new information about tumor samples by performing sample decomposition with tumor transcriptomes. In particular, we propose to exploit the wealth of pharmacological data available for cancer cell lines and develop a novel cell decomposition method to predict therapeutic vulnerabilities from tumor transcriptomes, and carry out the equivalent of a pharmacological screening in cancer patients. This project will allow studying at unprecedented detail the role of alternative splicing as determinant of therapy response. 	Mohammadi et al.

These oscillations have a variety of physiological functions including reacting to a dynamical environment. Studies of the biomolecular circuitry underlying these oscillators have been restricted so far to low-throughput analyses that are limited to small numbers of genes and do not take into account the intrinsic heterogeneity in cell populations. But the recent development of high-throughput transcriptomics data at the single-cell level is enabling us to address these issues using big-data approaches. The objective of this project is to evaluate and use a variety of statistical analysis methods  to provide a timeline to existing single-cell transcriptomics data sets.

We aim to understand the genomic variation and mechanisms that underlie adaptive trait variation. Our previous work has used the powerful parallel divergent adaptation to marine and freshwater environments in threespine stickleback to map >81 predominantly intergenic adaptive loci with kilobase resolution. This presents a unique opportunity to discover and functionally dissect molecular mechanisms influencing evolution in a naturally adapting organism. We are using diverse molecular genetic techniques to functionally annotate the adaptively diverging genomes of marine and freshwater sticklebacks.  We are looking for someone to join the bioinformatics side of this project to help study the genomic features of functional divergence in the context of an outgroup species. This project will involve de novo assembly using 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing data, comparative genomics (DNA alignment), and comparative epigenomics within and between species (ChIPseq, ATACseq, Capture C).

Zinc finger proteins are the largest family of transcription factors (TFs) in human (around the 50%). Their DNA binding domains are made of small domains called zinc fingers (ZFs). By putting several ZFs one after another, these proteins are able to recognize complex DNA sequences. They are relevant in many biological processes and diseases. Besides, they provide a platform for genome editing.   In our lab we have developed a method to predict the binding preferences of transcription factors. This method is based on using PDB structures and Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) data to compute statistical potentials. These statistical potentials, in combination with the modeling of TF-DNA interactions, can be used to score the DNA sequences bound by a TF. Therefore, we can use this system to study TF-DNA binding, differentiating stable from unstable TF-DNA interactions or assessing the effect of mutations affecting TF-DNA interactions.  However, our current methods do not perform well for the ZF protein family. This is because the PBM data that we are using does not consider the binding preferences of individual ZFs. New potentials should be computed using, instead of PBM data, bacterial one-hybrid data regarding individual ZFs. This involves building a database of ZF proteins and adapting the bacterial one-hybrid data to our already developed workflows. Then, the new potentials should be tested in order to find an optimal performance.  Our short term goal is to use these new methods to predict the binding of CTCF. CTCF is a zinc finger protein that plays a key role in genome architecture. CTCF binding sites are known to establish the boundaries between chromatin domains across the genome, also known as Topological Associated Domains (TADs). So far, 20% of all CTCF binding sites cannot be identified with nowadays bioinformatics tools. Our goal is to use these new methods to find this non identified CTCF binding sites.

However, the age- and gender-dependent trends of morbidity associations at a fine resolution remain poorly understood. In addition, less is known about pleiotropic effects that could explain the observed comorbidities and, thus, the existence of potential biomarkers for prevention. Using large data from morbidity associations and genome-wide studies (GWASs), we aim to reveal some underlying genetic basis of disease associations involving cancer and to define candidate biomarkers for prevention and/or risk estimation.	1.

However, the synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies and deviation from random use defines the codon usage bias (CUB). CUB varies between and within species, and it is also altered in certain human disease conditions. CUB has been essentially shaped by mutation and selection. Mutational bias and bias in repair mechanisms affect the general base composition of the genome, which in turns affects the CUB. Importantly, CUB and tRNA copy number have coevolved to optimize translation efficiency, translation accuracy and protein folding. Therefore, the regulation of codon usage has a central impact in evolution and may also contribute to the development or progression of certain diseases. In particular, evidence suggests that alteration in CUB influences carcinogenesis. There is a need to quantify the impact of CUB in cancer, bot at the level of development and progression. In this project, we plan to apply computational tools to process and analyze proteomic data of cancer samples (tumors and cell lines) and to assess alterations in CUB. The aim is to acquire evidence that perturbations of CUB are associated with specific cancer types and associated with clinical features.

Advances in whole genome sequencing and other high-throughput technologies allow us to identify and characterize the genes and traits more relevant for environmental adaptation. Most of our knowledge so far comes from the analysis of one type of genetic variant: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Other types of variants such as transposable element insertions, that are complex mutations likely to play a role in adaptation, are largely ignored. Our laboratory is at the forefront of the research aimed at elucidating the contribution of transposable to adaptation. In this project, we will apply our proven expertise in these research fields to elucidate the role of transposable elements in adaptation in Anopheles and humans. We have selected traits that are already known to be involved in adaptation in these two organisms: Anopheles ability to thrive in urban environments, and human ability to survive in high altitudes, toxic environments, heat stress, and pathogens. Adaptation to urban environments in Anopheles mosquitoes is highly relevant because it has direct consequences for the ability of these mosquitoes to transmit malaria. Adaptation of human populations to high altitudes, toxic environments, tropical rainforest, and pathogens involves several stress response pathways: hypoxia, heavy-metal, xenobiotics, heat, immunity, and oxidative stress. These pathways are directly related to multiple human diseases including neurodegenerative pathologies and cancer. We will use the latest technological advances in long-read sequencing techniques to generate de novo annotation of transposable elements in Anopheles genomes. We will then use state-of-the-art methodologies to look for signatures of selection suggesting that the identified transposable elements are indeed adaptive. To identify the role of transposable elements in human environmental adaptation, we will take advantage of the wealth of information already available for our species. We will complement this in silico analysis with functional validation of a subset of the identified candidate transposable element insertions. 		command line usage, bash scripting  	To be discussed	Computational genomics	third-generation sequencing, urban adaptation, stress adaptation, transposable elements,  	Yes	Interview with lab members required	Evolutionary and Functional Genomics					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnud39w-hTYDQpaNtruJX668eza2rb-N_7GsGTkmODCV0apDDC639Upjm7w

However, the annotation of the D. magna genome is being updated continously (www.fleabase.com). This means that the curtom made array needs to be re-annotated continoursly. Its correct annotaion is important since it will save time when searching for GERONTOLOGY (i.e. David, Blast2Go,...). The aim of this work is to re-annotate the existing 40K probes of the array.

We focus our research on the control of gene expression in human cells by chromatin organization, components and modifications. The degree of compaction of chromatin affecting a gene promoter dictates accessibility to transcription factors and RNA polymerase, and many chromatin modifying enzyme families act to overcome difficulties imposed by chromatin.  We investigate the role and specificity of histone H1 variants in chromatin organization and gene expression control. By RNA interference of the different human H1 variants we have found that they have different involvement in cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and gene expression. We have also described a differential role of H1 variants in pluripotency and differentiation. Currently, we are investigating the occupancy of H1 variants genome-wide by ChIP-seq (NGS) and the consequences of altering H1 levels on chromatin organization (ATAC-seq, DNA methylation, chromosome conformation-LADs, etc), with an extensive use of Genomics and Bioinformatics. Additionally, we are performing proteomics of H1 variant specific protein complexes in chromatin and nucleoplasm. 	➢ Izquierdo-Bouldstridge A*, Bustillos A*, Bonet-Costa C, Aribau P, Garcia D, Dabad M, Esteve-Codina A, Pascual L, Peiro S, Esteller M, Murtha M, Millán-Ariño Ll, Jordan A (2017) Histone H1 depletion triggers an interferon response in cancer cells via activation of heterochromatic repeats.

Thus, our main research lines are focused on aspects of human genome diversity, population genetics, genome variation and disease susceptibility, and genome evolution and disease. 1. Population processes Concerning population processes that have modeled the human genetic diversity, we have focused our research on the use of molecular tools to reconstruct the human population history through the phylogeny of genetic markers. Our interest has been focused on the genetic consequences at population level of human migrations and admixtures. The use of well-established phylogenies in the mitochondrial and Y-chromosome human genomes allowed us to unravel the population history of several populations. Nonetheless, we have recently used whole genome variation in the autosomes in order to establish the structure of human populations. 2. Genomic processes Concerning genomic processes that have modeled the human genetic diversity, our research has have been focused on the relationship between human diversity and complex traits, including complex diseases. The genetic analysis in human populations of genes of biomedical interest might shed light on the evolution of these genes. In this context, we have focused our research in the analysis of genes that have been previously associated to complex diseases, such as psychiatric and immunological diseases. The analysis of these genes has allowed us to conclude that some of the failures in replicating genetic associations are due to extreme genetic differences between populations. In addition, we are also interested in other complex traits, such as height, not directly related to disease.

Dynamic genome regulation in health and disease is driven by epigenetic changes that remodel chromatin and the expression of specific genes and non coding RNAs. Beyond regular epigenetic profiles associated with the ordinary components and factors involved in gene regulation, a number of sites convey singular epigenetic  traits with unknown but potentially key functional roles.  Odd feature sites will be initially fished using the DNA methylation profiles obtained by whole genome analyses in different cell types. Identified sites will be annotated with genetic and epigenetic features, including regulatory signals, and functional information.  Functional analyses using in silico modeling of integrated data and wet lab experiments will be performed. The expected outcome is the discovery of specific mechanisms of gene regulation with a potential impact on important biological functions, including cancer risk, progression and response to treatment. 		We expect basic theoretical knowledge in Epigenomics, including techniques (WGBS). Experience with Epigenomics and broad sense biological data repositories (ENCODE, UCSC) is highly desirable.  The project will be run in a GNU/Linux computing cluster (GRID), so knowledge of bash scripting is highly desirable.

Presumably not all neurons are identical, since some neurons project to auditory hair cells, whether others to vestibular areas, and different brain region. Our hypothesis is that distinct pools of neurons with a specific molecular gene expression profile exist within the SAG, depending on their localization. We aim to generate a spatial transcriptional map of the mouse SAG to uncover distinct population of sensory neurons. To date most of the gene expression analysis of tissues have been performed by dissecting large pieces of tissues or by isolation of cells by FACS sorting, where populations are mixed or where the spatial information of the cells is lost. In order to ascribe a molecular profile along the topological organization of the SAG, we plan to obtain around 15 groups of 5-10 neurons (along the 3-body axis) by laser capture microdissection (LCM). This technique that has been used to perform RNA-seq in very small groups of isolated cells (Zechel et al. 2014, Bandyopadhyay et al., 2014) or even single cells (in fixed and sectioned tissues or biopsies, allows to then obtain genomic or transcriptomic data without loosing the spatial information from where the cells were captured. Isolated cells will then be processed for RNA-seq to obtain their transcriptional profile. The candidate will be involved in using the RNA-seq datasets to obtain meaningful results of the differences in transcription overtime and overspace. This computational challenging project will be done together with the experimentalists of the lab.		skills in most used computational tools for RNA-seq data analysis, basic knowledge on statistics, R-code programming, skills in linux commands and operations	No	Computational genomics	RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics	To be discussed		Morphogenesis and Cell Signaling in Sensory Systems					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnufxrd5-9AV81yBRcbSO8ftix0wYORmeLh7piutztgX6Hko8qwMEaVBU

DisGeNET follows the FAIR data principles (http://www.datafairport.org/), and can be explored using a suite of tools that includes a web interface, a Cytoscape app, and a SPARQL endpoint. disgenet2r is a novel R package for exploring and analyzing DisGeNET. disgenet2r contains a variety of functions for leveraging DisGeNET using the powerful visualization and statistical capabilities of the R environment. disgenet2r is specially designed to harness the large amount of information contained in DisGeNET, facilitating its analysis and interpretation. By integrating different disease vocabularies, disgenet2r eases the exploration of gene-disease associations from different perspectives. It offers different types of visualization, such as heatmaps and networks, and it is especially well suited to explore genes and variants associated to diseases. To allow answering more sophisticated research questions that need the interrogation of heterogeneous data resources, the disgenet2r package leverages the potential of Semantic Web technologies, without the need of special expertise in this area. This is achieved through a set of functions that connect DisGeNET with other resources present in the Linked Open Data Cloud, covering different information such as gene expression, gene function, drug activity, and biological pathways, among others. The disgenet2r package expedites the integration of DisGeNET data with other R packages, and allows the development of complex bioinformatic workflows.   The aim of the project is to complete the development of the disgenet2r package, and to submit the package to Bioconductor. Specifically, the project will involve:  • Rewrite functions that connect to the DisGeNET database • Improvement visualization capabilities of disgenet2r functions • Review and fix code bugs • Code testing and documentation • Development of a case study for the documentation • Preparation of code for submission to Bioconductor • Writing of manuscript describing the package 	Gutiérrez-Sacristán A, Piñero J, Queralt-Rosinach N et al. disgenet2r: An R package to explore the molecular underpinnings of human diseases [version 1; not peer reviewed].

Some genes are born by gene duplication but others arise from previously non-coding regions of the genome. The latter process is called de novo gene birth and, contrary to gene duplication, generates proteins with completely new sequences.  In our group we are investigating how new genes arise de novo in mammals and yeast. To identify new events of translation we use ribosome profiling data (Ribo-Seq), which targets regions in the mRNAs that are being translated. We, and others, have discovered that may transcripts believed to be non-coding actually translate small proteins, or peptides, that may later evolve into new proteins.  The project will use RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq data to investigate the dynamics of de novo gene birth. We will use short read (Illumina) and long read (Oxford Nanopore) technologies to identify species-specific transcripts in yeast, and will identify translated proteins using Ribo-Seq data. We will also examine the effect of codon usage bias in the translation and composition of the new proteins.  	1. Ruiz-Orera, J, Verdaguer-Grau, P, Villanueva-Cañas, JL, Messeguer, X, Albà, MM (2018).

During the past decade, the coupling of immuno­precipitation with next ­generation sequencing has generated vast datasets of the genomic location of tran­scription factor­ binding sites and histone modifica­tion marks. Unfortunately, suitable and specific antibodies that target RNA modifications are currently available only for m6A, m1A, 5­methylcytosine and 5-­hydroxymethylcytosine, thus greatly limiting our understanding of the epitranscriptome [1].  The direct RNA sequencing platform that is being developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which comprises thousands of membrane­ embedded protein nanopores coupled to highly sensitive ammeters that measure ionic current passing through the pore. As a DNA or RNA molecule is propelled through the pore, the sensor measures disruptions in cur­rent, the characteristics of which can be used to identify the transiting nucleotides — including modified nucleo­tides — using hidden Markov models or recurrent neu­ral networks previously trained with known sequences. Notably, ONT can produce sequencing reads from single molecules and thus is potentially capable of producing quantitative transcriptome-­wide maps with single nucleo­tide resolution, with read lengths limited primarily by sample preparation. [2].  The MSc project will consist on training a base-caller and improving the accuracy of current RNA base-callers, using models that predict not only the 4 bases, but also RNA modifications. For this aim, we will use ONT data already produced in our lab, which consists in synthetic known sequences that contain specific modifications at known positions, will be used as input. The student will use HMM modeling as well as machine learning to build an efficient base-caller that predicts RNA modifications. The trained models will be then validated using biological datasets with known RNA modifications, and finally used to predict de novo RNA modifications genome-wide.

Genetics, Microbiology & Statistics, University of Barcelona		Development of a bioinformatics tool for feature extractions and matrix factorizations for detecting shared and view-specific components	While it is often challenging to combine features of multiple views in the original input spaces, new features generated by feature extraction methods can be easily combined. An idea is to extract new features from each data view first, and then incorporate these new features together. Finally, a classification or clustering algorithm can be applied on the combined features. Depending on the nature of an individual data view, a feature extraction method learns the representations of samples in a new feature space. Matrix factorization methods, such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, sparse representation and tensor decomposition methods, are commonly used feature extraction models.  This project aims to develop and implement an application combining several machine learning methods for multi-view data analysis such as GFAsparse (Sparse GFA for biclustering), iCluster (Integrative clustering of multiple genomic data types), r.jive (JIVE).

This will ultimately provide us with a quantitative description of the specificity of each interaction within the domain-motif networks considered. While we are currently developing and applying the experimental approaches for this purpose, the project also requires a strong bioinformatics component. In this line, the Master Student would be involved in developing routines plan, treat, store and display the very large amount of experimental data produced, the analysis of these data, and their biological interpretation.  Background: The human interactome -set of protein-protein interactions within a given organism- involves approximately 26,000 genes. When including all splicing isoforms this number may rise to 60,000 different proteins, which can furthermore be altered by multiple combinations of post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs). Currently, efforts are ongoing to “map” the human interactome by assessing the 26,000 x 26,000 potential interactions, excluding the spliced isoforms and multiple PTMs mentioned above. When looking at these interactomic approaches, most of them deliver results in a binary way (either “bind” or “not binds”) [1-3]. However, we think that this binary information is an inaccurate way to describe interactomes, since protein-protein interactions can display a very large palette of binding strengths or affinities. Taking into account the equilibrium of affinity constants (KD), the affinity can range from the picomolar scale (10-12M) to the milimolar scale (10-3M).  Affinities are crucial in biology and molecular biology as they determine the specificity of interactions. Measuring affinities in a generalized manner would be in principle the best way to quantify the specificity of a given binary interaction and to compare it with all the possible competing interactions involving either partner in the interaction. However, in practice this is not done, and the specificity of interactions is tackled either by qualitative approaches (interaction assays performed in the presence of a large amount of potential competitors in background, washing steps/buffers supposed to retain only specific interactions, etc…) or by comparative assessment of small number of affinities (the interaction of interest is shown to be stronger than a few selected alternative interactions) [1,2].  A large part of the protein-protein interactomes boil down to particular families of globular domains interacting with families of short conserved sequence motifs, the latter being generally situated in intrinsically unfolded regions of the proteome. This creates subsets of the interactome that can be dubbed “domain-motif interactomes”.    The PDZ domain is a common structural domain of 80-90 amino-acids found in the signaling proteins of bacteria, yeast, plants, viruses and animals. They usually have 4 β-strands and one short and one long α-helix (α + β topology). These domains are involved in a variety of cellular functions (signaling, cell polarity and adhesion, apoptosis). The main activity of PDZ domains is to bind to conserved short motifs -called PBMs (for PDZ-Binding Motifs)- generally situated at the extreme C-terminus of their partner proteins, sometimes involved in scaffolding functions. This domain is known for its promiscuity both in terms of ligand selection, mode of interaction with its ligands as well as its association with other protein interaction domains. PDZ domains are subject to several means of regulations by virtue of their functional diversity. The human proteome contains about 266 PDZ domains and about 5000 PBMs. The binding of these PBMs to the PDZ domain is led by several hydrogen bonds established between backbone atoms of the peptide and backbone atoms of the PDZ domain as can be observed for typical β-sheets. The peptide binding pocket of PDZ domains is formed by residues from the carboxylated binding loop, the β2 and β3 strand, the β2-β3 loop and the α2-helix [4,5].   The full mapping of the affinities of the entire human PDZ-PBM network will require the measurement of 266 x 5000 affinity data. We will also measure the interactions the 266 human PDZs with about 100 to 500 PBMs originating from viral proteins, which are known to hijack cellular activities mediated by human PDZ-containing proteins, thereby participating to a variety of pathologies including neuronal disorders (rabies, Tick-borne encephalitis...) and cancers (Cervical cancers, head and neck cancers, Merkel cell carcinoma...) [6].  To this aim, we have invented and are currently further developing a high-throughput assay named the Hold-Up assay, which is a highly reproducible comparative chromatographic approach that directly detects complexes at equilibrium and provides a quantitative binding value for the domain-motif complex [7]. This assay has been applied to the PDZ domain family, which contains 266 members across about 152 proteins in the human proteome.  Master Project: Our lab has a main experimental component, but the large amount of experimental data generated absolutely requires the powerful help of computational science. The data have to be curated, analyzed for their reproducibility and accurateness, and then subjected to bioinformatics analysis. In this line, we offer depending of the student’s qualities and interests, the possibility to work on the pipeline that links the outcomes of high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments to their computational data treatment and interpretation.   This pipeline would include the use and eventually the improvement of an in-house developed software that we use for the baseline correction and display of the interaction data obtained from the Hold-Up assay. The data are then stored into a local Data Base in constant expansion, which we plan to share with our collaborators from the HTS protein expression facility (Marseille) and the Institute Pasteur (Paris). Ultimately, we wish to allow user-friendly access and use of this database to our fellow experimentalists who do not have expert computing skills. An important part of the task of the master student will be to build and improve routines for creating from the Data Base, then statically analyzing so-called "Binding Profiles". We have currently about 30 such profiles, each corresponding to a plot of the 266 binding strengths of 266 human PDZdomains against one peptide sequence, and their number will be constantly raising together with our database. Our aim is to publish and share these PDZ-PBMs interaction profiles that we obtain to the common use of the scientific community. Such publications will present, together with the data, a thorough biological interpretation based on a variety of computational analyses of the data, and put in context of the large body of bibliography already existing on PDZ domains (4000 citations in Pubmed), with a particular emphasis on the topic of viral-induced hijacking of PDZ networks.

Furthermore, they can be also used as diagnostic tools to detect the presence of a known organism, which can be pathogenic or not, as well as to determine candidate novel sequences for previously unreported species. Our computational lab (COMPGEN, https://compgen.bio.ub.edu)￼ has been collaborating with Dra Rosina Gironés lab (VIRCONT, http://www.ub.edu/microbiologia_virology/)￼, in order to analyse metagenomic data from waste water and clinical samples, and to characterize the viral species from those samples. The lab also participates in the MetaWater consortium (https://compgen.bio.ub.edu/MetaWater/). Different computational approaches will be evaluated, implemented, and improved to assist in the identification of unique sequence patterns, which will be used as barcodes for the new metagenomic protocols to analyze new environmental/clinical samples. Such patterns will be useful for clustering sequences from the samples into taxonomic groups (OTUs). These patterns will enable new sequences to be classified into a given group, and will also be applicable in the construction of diagnostic primer sets. Once we have all data gathered and processed, a web interface will facilitate the navigation through the data and the associated analyses.

The overall aim of the project is to understand a specific aspect of the biogenesis and evolution of a class of small non-coding RNAs called PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs are non-coding RNAs that bind PIWI proteins. piRNAs and PIWI proteins are highly expressed in the germline of all animals and their predominant role is to repress transposons, this way preventing mutagenic transposon insertions that could otherwise be deleterious for the next generation. In addition to that, piRNAs have additional functions that are very poorly understood. For example, it has been proposed that mouse PIWI proteins are involved in the regulation of mRNAs expressed during spermatogenesis. The objective of the project will be to use sequence analysis and comparative genomics to understand how PIWI proteins distinguish between RNAs that should be processed into piRNAs from the rest.  It will also be possible to work on other projects related to the research lines of the group.  A candidate with her/his own ideas for a project is very welcome to come to discuss them with the PI.

08/03/2018 16:15:56	ferran.casals@upf.edu	Ferran Casals / Hafid Laayouni	UPF		Testing the digenic model for human disease	Whole exome sequencing has allowed characterizing the causal genes of tens of rare diseases in the last years. However, for an important proportion of patients the molecular origin remains unclear. Thus, other possible scenarios need to be explored. In this project, we propose the evaluation of the digenic model in the origin of primary immunodeficiencies. This form of disease refers to both situations with a primary and a secondary locus or cases where two loci contribute to the disease with roughly the same importance (1). Modifier genes, affecting the severity of the disease, can also be considered a type of digenic inheritance (2). Although promising, to date the number of reported examples in the literature with evidences of digenic inheritance remains quite low (3), probably because of difficulties in statistical and mainly functional analyses to demonstrate a real role in the disease (1). Because of features as their prevalence, variable penetrancies or phenotypic variation within families, primary immunodeficiencies are very good candidates for this model. The student will analyze whole-exome sequencing data for 30 primary immunodeficiency patients already generated in our lab. The project will consist in the integration of data from databases on the connectome, protein interactions and functional gene networks with genomic data and information on the predicted effect of genetic variants and gene essentiality indexs. The project is a good opportunity to introduce the students to the study of genetic diseases, and in particular immunodeficiencies, with a strong genomic and statistical component. 	1.  Schäffer AA.

Acinas	Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM), CSIC	http://www.icm.csic.es/	CRISPRs OMICS	UNVEILING NEW CRISPR-CAS SYSTEMS FROM THE GLOBAL OCEAN  Life started and first evolved in the oceans. Marine microbes were the first living organisms on Earth and they are recognized as the undisputed champions of biological diversity. This is reflected in their extraordinarily vast numbers, diversity and biochemical variability. A liter of seawater is teeming with billions of microbes -viruses, bacteria and protist-far exceeding all multi-cellular metazoa in abundance, biomass, metabolic activity, and genetic and biochemical diversity. Bacteria are a relevant component of the ocean’s food web: they are accounting with 10e29 cells in the global ocean. The total mass of bacteria in the oceans exceeds the combined mass of zooplankton and fishes representing a major player of the microbial world. Microbes are integral to the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, and to the chemistry of the ocean and its interaction with the atmosphere. Prokaryotes are responsible for 30% of the primary biomass production and 95% of the respiration in the ocean (Del Giorgio & Duarte, 2002) and they are the bases of most major oceanic food web. In addition, marine heterotrophic microorganisms play a major role in all fluxes of matter and energy in the oceans. Despite their ecological relevance there is only 11.500 especies of those only 653 are marine prokaryotes species described to date (Mora et al. 2011, Yarza et al. Nat. Rev. Microb. 2014).   There have been four major global research cruises to systematically map ocean biota so far: The Challenger Expedition (1872-1876), Craig Venter’s Global Ocean Survey (2003- 2008; Rusch et al. 2007), Tara Oceans expeditions (Tara Oceans, 2009-2012; Tara Oceans Polar Circle, 2012-2013; Sunagawa et al, 2015) and Malaspina Expedition 2010. The Malaspina expedition have represented a milestone in the Spanish science of XXI century, an unique expedition that has collected samples at global scale and at depths not sampled to date, specifically those from the bathypelagic ocean. Within Malaspina expedition, I am leading a project called Deep Malaspinomics that it was funded by the DOE Joint Genome Institute (US) under the program Community Sequencing Program (CSP) for the analysis of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of deep ocean microorganisms collected during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition.  Thanks to my leading work on specific projects within both expeditions Tara Oceans and Malaspina we have access to all metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from both expeditions. Currently we have about 301 metagenomes from 101 stations with a final dataset of 40.812.291 genes to what we called Global Ocean Microbial-Reference Gene Catalogue (GOM-RGV v1). This gene catalogue could be a valuable source for medical and technology discoveries.   One example of recent discovery that have impact biology, biotechnology and biomedicine has been the discovery of CRISPR-cas systems (Mojica et al 1993, 1995)- an adaptive immune system used by microbes to defend themselves against invading viruses by recording and targeting their DNA sequences (Mojica et al. 2005). Thanks to this basic research later other researchers turned out into the CRISPR- technology: a simple and reliable technique for genome editing, in living cells, the genomes of mammals and other organisms (Gasiunas et al. 2012; Jinek et al. 2012).   The main goal of this master project would the bioinformatics analyses our  unique microbial ocean gene catalogue and uncultivated prokaryotic genomes to: (1) extract CRISPR cas-gene sequences from uncultured microorganisms from the global ocean and (2) perform phylogenetic analyses to discover novel cas-system that may provide flexibility and specificity (reducing some off-target effect) in genome editing and (3) analyses the functional capacity of the microorganisms harbouring hypothetical novel CRISPRs cas-systems.  	1.

09/03/2018 7:46:10	abigas@imim.es	Anna Bigas	IMIM	www.imim.es	Mechanisms of leukemogenesis and resistance in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	Leukemia relapse, which is associated with therapy resistance, has been studied for a long time without providing valid alternatives for some groups of patients. It is nowadays that the power of new technologies invites to revisit this old question with a different perspective and expectations.  To provide definitive clues to this particular clinical subject, we have assembled a consortium comprised by internationally leading experts in three different disciplines of cancer/leukemia research including clinical, experimental and computational research. This is an ongoing project with funding support that aims to understand this question by the identification of genomic alteration driving tumourigenesis and therapy resistance in human ALL (in collaboration with the group of Nuria Lopez-Bigas). In parallel we are exploring alteration in pioneering chromatin factors in T-ALL that can have a direct impact on tumorigenesis by chip-seq and RNA-seq. We work with computational experts to help us integrate all the different ‘omics’ data and extract the best information from the biological data. In summary, this proposal aims to join efforts from groups with different but complementary expertise to uncover the mechanisms of therapy resistance in human T-ALL and provide new avenues for poor prognosis patients. Moreover, this study will potentially contribute to understand more general mechanisms of therapy resistance and clonal evolution of cancer cells.

In humans, this process is required by practically all pre-mRNAs to be properly ex-pressed. Furthermore, most pre-mRNAs can be spliced into different mRNAs by alter-native splicing, and perturbations in splicing are linked to disease. However, we know little on how this happens, or in fact on how global changes in pre-mRNA splicing are coordinated, for example during development or disease. To start addressing this ques-tion, we are analyzing WGS and RNASeq data from cancer patients. Although we are interested in all events of regulated splicing, we pay special attention to those related to the biosynthesis and function of the ribosome. A cycling cell depends on suitable set of ribosomes to provide the necessary amount of structural and functional proteins before mitosis; paradoxically, making this machinery requires most of the cell's energy (as an illustrative example, a growing HeLa cell is making 1.6 x105 ribosomal proteins per mi-nute). Thus we expect that fast-growing cell, subjected to a strong selection (such as a tumor cell) will tweak this process to get an advantage. In addition, the analysis of the transcriptome of ribosomal proteins presents specific challenges because (a), it in-cludes the mRNAs that are most abundant in the cell, but the amounts of each one are variable (while the ribosome has one of each protein); (b), the corresponding pre-mRNAs undergo little alternative splicing; and (c), the majority of human pseudogenes come from them, which introduces ambiguity when mapping reads to the genome. Our initial results suggest that processing of this set of transcripts is altered in cancer in unexpected ways, and we plan on strengthening our conclusions by expanding our analyses. In this context there are many opportunities for those with a strong motivation to document genomic strategies that control the transcriptome of specific gene families, like those related to the ribosome or the spliceosome. The tasks involve quality analysis of raw RNASeq data, mapping using standard tools (for example, Hisat, STAR, and those related to direct sequencing of RNA), statistical analysis (cummeRbund, Ballgown, DexSeq, or others), and modeling. Subject to pro-gress, we would explore the use of transcriptomics data as a disease prognosis tool; namely, is a distinct distribution of transcripts indicative of a particular disease outcome? 	* Hussain, S.

Users of bioinformatics tools, especially those that are not expert bioinformaticians, face the need of choosing the most appropriate tool for performing the desired analysis, among a huge list of options. Literature does not help to this task as few comparative reviews exists or are complete enough. This has led to the creation of tools registries. Such registries existed from the beginning of bioinformatics, however, most of them are just lists without any quality assessment. Also, at present the number of available registries are also large and information is highly redundant, and even contradictory. Within the Europan infrastructure ELIXIR (www.elixir-europe.org), our group is engaged in the generation of general benchmarking platform with the aim of offering a centralized view of Bioinformatics tools gathering information from existing registries, quality assessments taken from software repositories, scientific literature, and scientific benchmarking initiatives.  The proposal involves developing tools for gathering data from existing registries (bio.tools, BioSharing, OmicsTools, and others), journal articles, web sites, and software repositories (github, Galaxy, BioConda), and to integrate it in a central platform being built (https://elixir.bsc.es).  	https://www.elixir-europe.org, https://elixir.bsc.es	Proggraming skills in scripting languages, knowledge of web-based protocols, knowledge of database management	To be discussed	Web development & bioinformatic tools	Benchmarking, Software quality, Tools registry, ELIXIR, data integration	Yes		INB - BSC					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnucPFHO7S55aaq2dby_gf9jletxA2KChMxTAQ9y7vTOAXKolYmjgWN2l6g

They are the main cause of morbidity in women and, although they are generally not life-threatening, they significantly reduce the quality of life of patients and therefore have a very high socioeconomic impact.  Genomic variation has been shown to influence different aspects of autoimmune diseases, from disease susceptibility to response to treatments or severity. In our group, we have performed genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and identified several new risk loci for autoimmune diseases (Alonso, A et al. 2015; Julia, A et al. 2015; Aterido, A et al. 2016). However, by only associating genotypes with clinical outcomes the inference on the disease-causing mechanisms can be limited. The measure of the endogenous metabolites in cells or body fluids, metabolomics, can help to leverage this genetic association with disease. Biochemical measurements of particular intermediate phenotypes on a continuous scale can be expected to provide more details on potentially affected pathways and to be more directly related to the aetiology of the disease. Therefore, genetic variants that associate with the homeostasis of key metabolites may provide a more powerful access to the underlying molecular disease-causing mechanisms. Recently, we have performed the first metabolomic analysis on 6 different autoimmune diseases and healthy controls (Alonso, Julià et al. 2016). In this analysis, we have found shared patterns and also distinct metabolite expression for each disease.  The objective of the study that will be carried by the student is to identify the genetic variation with metabolite levels using a GWAS approach. Using metabolite patterns as endophenotypes for disease, we expect to find new and interesting genetic associations that can help to advance in the understanding of the disease etiology. This type of study is really novel and will require the use of advanced computational genomics techniques and high quality data from large and well characterized patient cohorts. 	Alonso, A., et al.

Data transmission is still a major bottleneck, both for technical limitations of the network, and for legal regulations, especially when human data is involved. The obvious solution is to bring analysis software to the places where data is stored, typically using cloud based solutions. This allows to limit transmissions to analysis results, with smaller sizes. The approach, however, makes difficult to manage a large project as computation is distributed among sites of heterogenous nature, and data is fragmented. Additionally, when a single analysis requires accessing data that is distributed, this approach is not feasible.  The proposal aims to join data stored at geographically distributed cloud facilities, and data from public repositories in a single virtual data space, offering to users and developers a single view of all data involved in the project, and providing the necessary information to software tools to find the appropriate input data irrespective of its actual location, and to minimize data transmission.

These advances contrast with our understanding of microbial evolution in timescales ranging from weeks to years, in which both evolution and ecology mingle. How do microbes evolve in complex natural ecosystems? Does natural selection act similarly across microbial species in the same community? How does microbial evolution affect ecology? We do not have clear answers to these questions, which expose one of the biggest unanswered questions in biology: How do microbes evolve in the wild?  Exploring this question is the main objective of this project. To achieve this goal, the project will leverage a unique convergence of resources (a natural "frozen" evolutionary DNA archive & computing power), capability (Big-Data generation & analysis) and host expertise (evolution & ecology). The specific objective of this project will be to understand the evolution that occurred in ~30 selected marine microbial species over 3 years using multiomics and high-performance computing. For this, we will use time-series metagenomics (i.e. monthly metagenomes, total 35), which were obtained from the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory and which are already sequenced and ready to be used. Based on these metagenomes, Population Genomes will be produced (initial analyses indicated ca. 30 high quality population genomes). In addition, Single-Amplified Genomes (SAGs), obtained during the last 2 years and processed at the Single Cell Genomics Laboratory (Bigelow, US), are ready to be used in this project.    Specific aspects of the project:  Rationale: Natural selection is expected to act differently in different species. Goals: Analyse the microevolution of abundant (therefore ecologically important) species in the community determining main patterns (e.g. effects of selection vs. drift across species, divergence rates, genome areas under selection). Specific hypotheses: Species feature distinct microevolutionary patterns, featuring slow and fast evolvers. Genes under selection in different species tend to be different. Task 1 Generate ~30 Population Genomes (PGs) to investigate evolution: Metagenomic DNA sequence reads covering monthly samples from 3 years will be mapped against the co-assemblies using BWA (Li & Durbin 2009), and DNA sequences (i.e. contigs) belonging to the putative same species will be grouped into bins using Metabat2 (Kang et al. 2015) or similar. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic bins will be determined, and their quality assessed using checkM (Parks et al. 2015) together with BUSCO (Waterhouse et al. 2017). Only those bins featuring >50% of genome completeness and <10% of contamination (that is, redundancy in single-copy genes) will be used in downstream analyses (Bowers et al. 2017), considering them as high-quality population genomes. The evolution in population genomes featuring >50% of completeness should be representative of the evolution occurring in the entire genome. Task 2 Gene prediction & annotation: As different gene predictors may predict different number of genes, de-novo gene prediction will be done using MetaGeneMark (Zhu et al. 2010), Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) and Prokka (Seemann 2014), and a consensus of their predictions will be used. Similarly, as different gene databases include different reference genes and annotation approaches, predicted genes will be annotated using Pfam (Finn et al. 2016), KEGG (Kanehisa & Goto 2000), eggnog (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2016) as well as other databases, and different annotations will be used depending on the task to be performed. Task 3 Determining mutations on Population Genomes (PGs) & Single-Cell Genomes (SCGs):  Metagenomic DNA sequence reads will be mapped against 1) PGs & 2) SCGs in order to determine the mutations at the population level (PGs) as well as at the single-cell or strain level (SCGs). Task 4 Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV) calling: Time-series metagenomic DNA sequence reads covering monthly samples from 3 years will be mapped using BWA(Li & Durbin 2009) against co-assemblies and SCGs, considering in the previous case only the most abundant taxa. SNVs (that is, mutations) will be detected using metaSNV (Costea et al. 2017), Midas (Nayfach et al. 2016), as well as our in-house SNV-calling protocol based in mpileup from samtools (Li et al. 2009). metaSNV and Midas are the best available tools for estimating genomic variation based in metagenomic data, while our in-house protocol allows tweaking more parameters than in the mentioned programs. SNVs will be considered if at least 4 variant-containing reads cover a sequence base (position) across all samples, thus discarding sequencing errors randomly distributed across the genome. Task 5 Analyses of mutations: It is important to determine what mutations arise locally vs. those that arrive by immigration and for which there is no information about their time or place of appearance. For example, an immigrant mutation could have emerged 50 years ago, before the time of the current microevolution study, or it could have emerged in a different population with a different genetic background. Identifying and separating these immigrant mutations is important to prevent noise in the study of the gradual accumulation of mutations arising in situ over time, which is one of the main aims of this project in order to understand microevolution in the wild. As shown by a previous study that the supervisor co-leads (Giner et al. 2017), large microbial immigration events have been rare during 10 years in the study site, thus large numbers of incoming mutations are not expected. Locally emerging mutations will be determined by analysing their chronological accumulation. Mutations that do not follow this rule will not be considered, as they could have emerged elsewhere. The emergence, fixation and gradual accumulation of mutations (SNVs) over time will be analysed. The ratio between non-synonymous vs. synonymous (dN/dS) mutations will be used to determine the action of selection in genes. Other effects of SNVs in genes will be analysed using SnpEff (Cingolani et al. 2012).  Feasibility: The supervisor has ample experience in bioinformatics analyses using metagenomes, as well as with analysing large datasets with computer clusters. All proposed bioinformatics tools and gene databases were carefully selected by the supervisor, representing the best available options to achieve the proposed goals. High-Performance computing will be carried out at the host institution bioinformatics platform Marbits as well as at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC; https://www.bsc.es), which host the largest supercomputer in Spain: MareNostrum. Proposed SNV calling approaches are designed for huge datasets.  Expected results: Results will permit determining evolutionary patterns and rates in ~30 species throughout 3 years. Gain: New insights on the evolutionary patterns shown by microbial species evolving in the sea that may foster new ideas. Conclusions on whether or not genes under natural selection in different species are mainly different.

The ICM includes a staff of ~300, including researchers, technicians and administrators. The general goal of the ICM is to perform multidisciplinary marine research. The ICM is the largest center for marine research in Spain and a leading institution around the world. During the past years, research at the ICM has been funded by several Spanish as well as European Union projects (e.g. ITN-SINGEK [H2020] of which the supervisor is partner, BioMarKs, MicroB3, Devotes [EU cooperation projects]). Within the ICM, the Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography conducts basic research on all aspects of marine ecology, diversity, biogeography and evolution. The ICM features the Marbits eco-informatics platform, which the supervisor directs. Marbits will be available for this project. In addition, the ICM-CSIC runs the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (which provides this project the unique frozen DNA evolutionary archive), having dedicated technicians for the monthly sampling and monitoring that is carried out since 2001. Besides, the ICM-CSIC provides a stimulating research atmosphere, welcoming students and postdocs from all over the world. Since 2013, the ICM-CSIC has hosted master students from the UPF Master in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences (at least 7). Two former UPF MSc students are presently carrying out their PhD studies at this institution (one is supervised by the supervisor of this project), and another former student is currently employed as a bioinformatics technician (within a project of the supervisor of this project).

They occlude the simple view of a linear path from genotype to phenotype because single genetic alterations at the interacting loci do not manifest a phenotypic effect. The phenomenon of genetic interactions has been shown to account of a fraction of the heritability of complex traits and to be responsible for the incomplete penetrance of many genetic disorders. For this reason, there is currently a pressing need and widespread interest in the identification of genetic interactions, which has translated into advances in high-throughput genetic screens. These advances have enabled probing genetic interactions at an unprecedented scale. However, high-throughput genetic screens have to be conducted under specific experimental conditions that not always match the conditions under study and it is virtually impossible to run those screens in every cellular context. There are computational methods to attempt predicting genetic interactions considering the experimental condition of interest. However, the way in which they incorporate cellular context into their algorithms is rather simplistic with a poor predictive performance. In this project we propose to exploit a recent statistical framework we have developed in our research group (see Roverato and Castelo, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. C, 66:647-665, 2017; doi:10.1111/rssc.12166) based on the covariance decomposition over the paths of an undirected graph that models the condition-specific transcriptional network inferred from high-throughput gene expression data. The main goal is to extend this framework to incorporate additional molecular features and build software to predict condition-specific genetic interactions that substantially improves the current state-of-the-art of the available tools for this purpose.		statistics, programming	No	Computational genomics	genetic interaction, transcriptomics, synthetic lethality	Yes		Functional Genomics					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnudP05eSbYYqmV3cA0rjBLeWjAob3jHOOoTqVj2G8tGIBK6GWxuUQyWJow

In particular, the project will investigate the brain and heart transcriptomes in a murine model of Williams-Beuren syndrome, and the neuronal transcriptome in a murine model for X-fragile syndrome. Additionally, we will investigate the repercussion of a pharmacological treatment that has shown to revert specific traits of the models. We will investigate how a compound that targets the endocannainoid system affects RNA processing and splicing in the mouse in heart, brain and neuronal tissues. Moreover, we will investigate whether in the mouse models, where this compound is known to recover a normal phenotype, the expression and splicing differences with respect to the control mice are reverted. The project will entail the analyses of the datasets, the identification of relevant genes for further experimental validation, and the in-depth study of the splicing mechanisms involved, and the exploration of the role of splicing in some of the co-morbidities observed in rare disease.

The analysis of this Real World Data (RWD) opens different possibilities for research but also to develop analytical tools to help the management of patients. We have recently developed an RWD analytical approach to identify patient disease trajectories over time, by data mining of longitudinal patient databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29523868). This methodology allows the discovery of common disease trajectories in the population and their clustering to identify multimorbidity patterns.   The proposed project involves the implementation of an R package implementing this methodology. Specifically, the project will involve:  • Implementation of all the functions of the package based on available code (python/Matlab). Different Matlab to R converters will be explored for this purpose • Implement different visualizations of the results (tables, heatmaps, networks, among others). We will also explore the use of Cytoscape for visualization purposes using Cytoscape Automation (https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki)  • Code testing and documentation • Development of a case study for the documentation • Preparation of code for submission to Bioconductor • Writing of manuscript describing the package 	1: Giannoula A, Gutierrez-Sacristán A, Bravo Á, Sanz F, Furlong LI.

12/03/2018 0:10:35	ingemm.adelpozo@gmail.com	Angela del Pozo	Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics (INGEMM). Hospital La Paz. Madrid	-	Analysis of pseudogenes with NGS: PKD1 as an example	The Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics (INGEMM) is focused in the diagnosis and research of diseases with a genetic etiology. The institute is located within La Paz Hospital in Madrid and it is composed by a multidisciplinary team of around 90 people. INGEMM is also part of the IdiPAZ Health Research Institute and belongs in addition to the Center for Biomedical Research in the Rare Diseases Network of the Carlos III Health Institute (CIBERER).  INGEMM has been designed to integrate the different specialists working in its facilities from a multidisciplinary point of view. Thus, in the same physical space there are dependencies associated with molecular and cytogenetic diagnostic tests and also consultations attended by medical personnel. In this way, a global attention is proposed to the patient with the main goal of improving the diagnosis of diseases with a genetic basis.  High throughput techniques (i.e. NGS) has been implanted in the INGEMM as diagnostic test. In order to address the management and analysis of the large volume of data generated by the NGS platforms, the Bioinformatics Section has been created 5 years ago. Currently, the section is formed by four members and is equipped with computational resources to meet the demand for assistance.  The Bioinformatics Section has developed two pipelines of analysis that are in production: one focused on determining germline mutations and another complementary, in which the objective is to characterize variants in mosaic that are in a low allelic frequency. However, these pipelines still fail in determining variants in genes sharing high homology, mainly due to the presence of pseudogenes. In many cases, they are locus strongly associated with clinical phenotypes and therefore it is crucial to overcome this issue to achieve a diagnosis.  One example is the Polycystic kidney disease. This is the most common hereditary kidney disease with an incidence of 1 case per 500 to 1000 live births - depending on the country- and is the cause of 10% of terminal status of renal disease. Mutations in gene PKD1 (Polycystin-1) are responsible of 85% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most common type of this disorder. This gene posses 46 exons along 53 Kb of chromosome 16. A large part of the 5 'end of the gene (exons 1 to 33) is duplicated in at least 6 copies sharing a great homology with the functional locus. These duplications make the characterization of variants by NGS highly difficult, being necessary the development of alternative approaches to be able to screen this gene in patients with suspicion of  ADPKD.  Although there is some previous works [1][2], from a bioinformatic point of view, there is no an standard approach that deals with locus that share pseudogenes in relation of the mechanisms that originated them. Any bioinformatics method must solve two main issues: identify variants from the locus of interest and flag those coming from the homologous regions (thus the reads that support them) in order to filter them out.   In non-processed pseudogenes this last question is crucial specially in those cases in which the mechanisms had come from a duplication as the inclusion of reads from the duplicated locus mislead the interpretation of variants.  So, it is proposed a project with the goal of developing a test model that can analyze loci with associated pseudogenes. For this, it is planned to implement a method that will be tested on PKD1 gene and could be validated in the reference sample of the NIST NA12878. At the end of the project the student will provided as deliverable a documented script and a reports with the results.  It is planned the following milestones to achieve the goals: - Compilation of bibliography of bioinformatic methods of pseudogenes processing as well as information about the origin and characteristics of PKD1 pseudogenes  - Bechmarking studio of 'variant callers' tested in genes with pseudogenes assoaciated. It will be tunned up using the sample NA12878 as reference. - Development of a analysis method based on the point before and applied it over a set of around 250 samples sequenced with a custom renal gene panel of which there is a subset of validated mutations.

12/03/2018 4:43:07	xbarril@ub.edu	Xavier Barril	Universitat de Barcelona	http://www.ub.edu/bl	Can structural stability predict activity cliffs in protein-ligand complexes?	The goal of the Barril’s lab is to discover bioactive molecules that bind to unexplored sites of action, exploiting novel mechanisms to achieve a therapeutic effect. To do so, we apply state of the art structure-based drug discovery methods, many of which have been developed in-house.  One of the current focus of the group is structural stability – a resistance of the system to structural changes. This fundamental property of protein–ligand complexes has been so far neglected in drug design. Certain hydrogen bonds present strong opposition to small structural distortions and can act as kinetic traps because the local environment hinders the transition from a direct hydrogen bond to a water-bridged interaction [1]. Therefore, they are a perfect example of structural feature providing structural stability to a complex. Based on that concept a new computational method, Dynamic Undocking (DUck) [2], has been developed. It provides a fast way to asses structural stability of the complex.  In this research project, we will challenge the concept of structural stability with activity cliffs (i.e. pairs of structurally similar compounds presenting large potency difference). In medicinal chemistry, activity cliffs are crucial in systematic structure− activity relationship (SAR) analysis to identify structural modifications that determine SAR characteristics [3]. An analysis of a large set of matched molecular pairs [4,5] will be performed using DUck and other computational tools. With the help of statistics and specific examples we will explore if structural stability can explain activity cliff formation. 	[1] Schmidtke, P., Luque, F. J., Murray, J. B., & Barril, X. (2011).

12/03/2018 12:39:51	cjimenezm@fsjd.org	Cecilia Jimenez-Mallebrera	Hospital Sant Joan de Deu	disease-maps.org/duchenne	The DMD-Map	Mutations in the DMD gene leading to the deficiency of the dystrophin protein from the sarcolemma of muscle fibres. Since the identification of its genetic etiology 30 years ago, there has been a huge effort to understand the molecular and pathological mechanisms of the disease. As a result, nowadays we have a reasonable understanding of the key pathways underlying DMD pathology and there are numerous clinical trials underway that target some of the events downstream of dystrophin deficiency. However, there are still many challenges, such as what are the potential drug-drug interactions (in particular with corticosteroids, which are the standard of care for DMD) and the lack of biomarkers that can serve as surrogate end-points in clinical trials. A limitation for research in DMD and other muscular dystrophies is the fractionation of knowledge and the limited integration between studies, even at the high-throughput data level.  A disease map is a comprehensive, knowledge-based representation of disease mechanisms that include signalling, metabolic and gene regulatory processes with evidence of their relationships to pathophysiological causes and outcomes. The Disease Maps Project is a large-scale community effort (disease-maps.org) of groups working on selected diseases, ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration, which was initiated at the LCBM in Luxemburg and the EISBM in France. The aim of this proposal in to generate a repository that describes molecular mechanisms of DMD “DMD-map” and that will support biomarker identification, omics data interpretation, identification of disease types, mapping drug action mechanisms, developing predictive models and suggesting therapeutic strategies. The DMD map will be an interactive, open access resource, providing a reference for the scientific community. At present, such a resource does not exist. It will be built by data mining of the scientific literature and by following the advice of a panel of collaborating experts. The map will have the potential to be further enriched by integrating public omics datasets.  In the longer term, the map will be the basis for a predictive mechanistic model with which effects of single or multiple drugs can be simulated; this should accelerate and reduce the cost of drug trials and the translation into patients. Finally, the information and experience gained in constructing the DMD-map could be applied to other muscular dystrophies and myopathies, thus benefiting a wide range of patients with neuromuscular conditions.

Besides the need to deal with multiple, mixed languages (e.g. Spanish and Catalan), clinical notes are characterized by several linguistic peculiarities like the extensive use of abbreviations and negations, the use of hypothetical language or the presence of a wide range of expressions exploited to refer to a specific entity, like a disease or a diagnostic procedure. Automated approaches to effectively deal with such linguistic aspects of clinical texts are essential in order to enable more complex analyses and data aggregations.  This master project focuses on the investigation, implementation and evaluation of approaches for the characterization of negations in clinical texts. Negation is a linguistic device frequently used in this kind of texts since a relevant part of the clinical concepts that are mentioned (e.g. a specific symptom) is negated. As a consequence, being able to automatically decide if a concept is negated constitutes an essential step in the analysis of clinical notes. This master project deals with the creation of a manually-curated corpus of clinical texts that gathers examples of negations of clinical concepts and the subsequent exploitation of such corpus to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool useful to automatically identify if a mention of a concept is negated. In a first phase of the project the student will be involved in the manual identification and annotation of examples of negations of clinical concepts so as to create the corpus of negations: the student will deal with Spanish and Catalan clinical texts. In parallel, the student will investigate NLP approaches and tools to process clinical text with a special focus on the characterization of negations. The second phase of the project will deal with the implementation of a machine learning approach for negation identification: this approach will be tuned (trained) and evaluated on the corpus annotated in the first phase.

Clinical notes are characterized by several linguistic peculiarities like the extensive use of abbreviations and negations, the use of hypothetical language or the presence of a wide range of expressions exploited to refer to a specific entity, like a disease or a diagnositc procedure. Automated approaches to effectively deal with such linguistic aspects of clinical texts are essential in order to enable more complex analyses and data aggregations.  During this master project, the student will focus on the investigation, implementation and evaluation of approaches to automatically identify and interpret abbreviations in clinical notes. Abbreviations are frequently used in this kind of texts: often an incorrect interpretation of abbreviations prevents a consistent interpretation of the content of these texts. The master project will be articulated in two phases: in a first phase the student will create a manually-curated corpus of texts that gathers examples of abbreviations of clinical concepts together with the related non abbreviated expression: Spanish and Catalan clinical texts will be considered. In a second phase this corpus will be exploited to set up a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool useful to automatically spot abbreviations: this tool will rely on the corpus of abbreviations built during the first to be tuned and evaluated.

The purpose of this transcriptome was finding genes that could be related to male-specific function. Interestingly, these massive data included evidence of many different transposable elements from many types and families, which were not expected given the source of data: the actively transcribed part of the beetle genome. The purpose of this project would be mining all the transposon data from this resource, characterizing them and finding their evolutionary relationships with other mobile elements characterized from animals.		I am mainly looking for a creative student, able to develop independent thinking, with at least some basic skills on how to handle data and most importantly to sustain and develop additional knowledge and skills through exploration.

However, RNA-seq has strong limitations to study the diversity of isoforms that higher eukaryotes typically express and are part of their organismal complexity. New third-generation sequencing technologies, such as PacBio, based on single molecule sequencing, generate long reads that are able to resolve isoforms without the need of a assembly step. This offers new opportunities to study isoform expression and isoform function. The CIPF lab has applied this technology to study neural differentiation in mice and has developed new software tools to analyze PacBio reads and to profile the functional consequences of differential isoform expression. While these approaches have worked in the mouse neural system, it is unclear to us how isoform functional diversity is shaped in other biological systems. Today, an important number of Pacbio datasets have been published for different species, including plants and farm animal. This Masters project will consist in the analysis of these public data to extract pan-species patterns of functionality associated to alternative isoform expression. The project has the following tasks 1. Collect several Pacbio Iso-seq datasets from the public domain on plants and animals. 2. Process data with the TOFU2 pipeline to obtain transcripts 3. Curate data with the SQANTI tool developed at the CIPF lab 4. Functionally annotate datasets with the IsoAnnot pipeline developed at CIPF 5. Identify orthology relationships between genes and isoforms and compare functional relationships 6. Browse data using the tappAS software developed at CIPF.	1.

One of our main research lines is the functional and evolutionary analysis of polymorphic inversions in the human genome. Despite being one of the first types of genetic changes characterized, the difficulty in the study of inversions represents a big challenge in human genetics. Therefore, we are developing novel experimental and bioinformatic methods to obtain a reliable catalogue of polymorphic inversions in the human genome, determine their distribution in world-wide human populations, and assess their functional and evolutionary impact, both with regard to their effect on gene expression and on nucleotide variation patterns. In particular, the proposed tasks span a diverse range of themes and could vary according to the interest and background of the candidate.   1. Analysis of inversion predictions from new generation genomic data to improve our current catalogue of human inversions and assess the performance of the technology. This information will be used to find interesting candidates for further studies and update the human polymorphic inversion data base InvFEST (http://invfestdb.uab.cat/).   2. Molecular evolution analysis of the effect of inversions on nucleotide variation patterns in the human genome to estimate their effect on mutation and recombination rates.   3. Comparative study of known human inversion regions in other mammal species genomes to determine if there are inversion recurrence hotspots conserved over long evolutionary distances that might indicate a potential functional role.

In spite of its importance, some important issues remains unsolved, and they are being vigorously investigated. Currently, our research group generates and uses genomic and transcriptomic data of spiders (Chelicerata) to adress two main objectives, i) understanding the relative role of the different evolutionary forces in the rapid diversification of the genus Dysdera in Canary Islands, and identifying their genomic determinants and, ii) study the molecular evolution of the major components of the chemosensory system in chelicerates and, by extension, in arthopods.   To acomplish these objectives, we are using comparative genomics and transcriptomics approaches, under the theoretical framework of molecular evolutionary genetics to identify the genomic regions and gene functions driving diversification. We applied powerful bioinformatics tools to detect changes in coding and non-coding regions, in gene copy number (including the caractherization of gene gains and losses), and in gene expression levels associated with speciation processes.   The student will participate in the assembly and annotation of the Dysdera silvatica genome. At this time, we have both genomic (a highly fragmented genome draft assembled from short read data) and transcriptomic (RNAseq data) data and we plan to generate long-read data with Oxford Nanopore real time sequencing technology. The student will contribute to obtain a new, more continuous genome assembly by incorporating long read data to the previous analyses, and to the in silico functional annotation of this genome sequence. To do that, the student will learn and use specific software for hybrid assembly, such as MaSurCA, ab initio gene prediction methods, implemented software such as AUGUSTUS or GeneID, and popular tools for gene annotation such as BLAST, HMMMER, Interpro or BLAST2GO.

Like all biomedical measurement techniques, the power of MRI comes hand in hand with some complicated and nuanced limitations, largely arising due to differences in images derived from different scanners. An understanding of the scope of these limitations is critical to successfully applying MRI biomarkers in large multi-site research projects which use data taken in many different models of scanner from multiple vendors. The European DTI Study on Dementia database provides multiple types of MRI images are acquired for many subjects using numerous different scanners. Using this database, the project aims to examine the effects of multi-site acquisition on large projects, testing the limits of sensitivity to assist in execution of future projects in MRI based neuroimaging.  The student will work alongside the scientific engineers at QMENTA to conduct data analysis using a state of the art scientific cloud processing platform to derive biomarkers and measure the variation in the biomarkers across different scanners and imaging sites or protocols.

In order to understand how genome complexity evolved, we are studying the genomes of the closest unicellular relatives of animals, including the ichthyosporeans.   Among the organisms that we are studying, the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma arctica has a bigger and more complex genome compared to other animal relatives.  A study of its genome architecture has unveiled the presence of a large number of copies of LTR retrotransposons which seem to have been recently active. Interestingly, there is a set of genes in the genome of Sphaeroforma, which are easily distinguishable from the rest because they are 1) more abundant, 2) AT richer, 3) smaller, 4) seldom expressed, 5) not conserved and most importantly, 6) related with transposable elements (TEs). Among these genes, there is a dam methylase gene found in high copy numbers. Dam methylases are of bacterial/phage origin and are important, for DNA repair, replication and regulation of gene expression. Because the Dam methylase family found in Sphaeroforma is often found inside a LTR retrotransposon, this opens some important evolutionary questions, such as 1)  the origin of this dam methylase gene, 2) its association with the LTR retrotransposon, and 3) the role of the LTR retrotransposon in the spreading and in the increase in copy number for this gene. This study will unveil the consequences of the spreading of a Dam methylase activity for both the evolution of the LTR retrotransposon and for the Sphaeroforma genome  Besides Sphaerofoma, our labs are working with different ichthyosporeans species for which we are also developing genetic tools. These organisms have the potential to become important models to understand cell biology and evolution.

There is therefore a growing interest in identifying early on in the drug discovery and development process potentially problematic protein targets (i.e. proteins whose targeting by drug(s) will result in serious adverse effects).  In this context, Bioinfogate has developed the translational safety database, OFF-X, which provides integrated preclinical toxicity and clinical adverse events findings for drugs and their associated targets in all phases of drug R&D. The portal is being used by major pharmaceutical companies worlwide to de-risk their R&D projects. In addition , Bioinfogate is working towards characterizing the sub-networks associated to such targets using network-based expansions on the human interactome. The aim of the project is 1) to design and construct a database consolidating the data on network expansion of therapeutic targets and adverse effects described in OFF-X, and 2) develop the procedures and methods to link the two databases so information can be retrieved through tailored searches. The overall aim of the project is to create a platform that can be used to uncover novel target-adverse event relationships not yet reported experimentally and to inform the pre-clinical and clinical drug development specialists of potential adverse-events derived from novel therapeutic targets. 	www.targetsafety.info	- Programming and/or scripting experience - Experience working on relational database (e.g. MySQL, Oracle) - Systems biology & Network analysis - Experience working with Cytoscape or other visualization tools	Yes	Pharmacoinformatics & systems pharmacology	Data Science, Drug Discovery, Drug adverse reactions, interactome, network-based expansion	Yes	The possibility to continue from Bioinfogate to a PhD directed by Dr. Narcis Fernández-Fuentes at UVIC will be considered (http://mon.uvic.cat/bms/)	Bioinfogate					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnufg140qBNk6yq7NVTXBHVFZNJKL48zNeg5KoaJOGXfUfIwt2y97M9xR4A

This will pave the way for the computational design of peptide drugs and patient specific T cell receptors.

Two of the most fascinating transitions occurred on the stem lineages leading to animals and to fungi, leading to a remarkable diversity of forms in both kingdoms. In recent years, our group has participated in genome sequencing projects for the closest unicellular relatives of both animals and fungi. This project will apply state of the art phylogenetic techniques to compare animal and fungal genomes to their unicellular relatives in order to reconstruct the changes in gene content that accompanied their separate origins hundreds of millions of years ago. We aim to identify genes with roles in cell-cell adhesion, communication and signaling in a multicellular context in both animals and in fungi, and to catalog previously uncharacterized gene classes that may have been co-opted independently for multicellularity in both lineages.

Although GPCRs have been extensively studied over the past decades, the underlying molecular and structural mechanisms responsible for many critical regulatory processes of this protein superfamily remain elusive. Understanding the dynamics of receptor functionality is currently a major challenge in molecular biophysics and a requirement for the rational design of drugs with improved therapeutic profile. For this reason, a promising approach to elucidate the molecular basis of GPCR functionality are molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a potent computational technique capable of generating atomic-resolution simulations of the structural motions of a molecular system. Consequently, MD simulations are increasingly being applied to the study of GPCRs, as reflected by the rapid upsurge of publications concerning this topic. In view of the growing importance of MD simulations, the GPCRmd project (www.gpcrmd.org) was created with the purpose to build the GPCRmd database, a database of MD simulations of GPCRs capable to foster data from all-over the world. The GPCRmd database will be linked to GPCRdb, a database of reference for the study of GPCRs. An essential feature of the GPCRmd database will be the GPCRmd viewer. This web-based platform provides visualization and analysis tools specifically designed for the evaluation of structural and dynamic data of GPCR family members.  In this Master project, the student will be involved in the design and development of new interactive analysis tools for the study of GPCRs, which will be incorporated in the GPCRmd viewer webpage. Such analysis tools will be focused on the study of the complex signalling network of intra-protein interactions that ultimately determine the response of the GPCR to a given drug. This includes the automatized detection and classification of different types of relevant interactions, comparison of the interaction network of different receptors (phylogenetically related receptors, wild type vs. mutant, ...), comparison of the network at different stages of a given molecular process, etc. Moreover, the obtained analysis tools will be applied to a case-study with the final aim to better understand how the intra-protein interaction network of a receptor of interest is affected by different stimuli or alterations (binding of a given ligand, receptor mutations, …).  The student will learn about GPCR biology, protein dynamics and in silico drug design, as well as web development, biomedical data analysis and biological databases. The internship can be extended into a PhD thesis. We expect that the GPCRmd database will have high impact on GPCR research and the discovery for new drugs. This will be communicated in a relevant publication to which the Master student will contribute.  	www.gpcrmd.org	Experience in structural biology. Python, HTLM/CSS and web page design.

Although GPCRs have been extensively studied over the past decades, the underlying molecular and structural mechanisms responsible for many critical regulatory processes of this protein superfamily remain elusive.

Consequently, MD simulations are increasingly being applied to the study of GPCRs, as reflected by the rapid upsurge of publications concerning this topic.  Yet, molecular dynamics present one drawback: obtaining simulation data sufficient to capture relevant biological events is computationally highly expensive. An excellent solution for achieving such computational resources is volunteer distributed computing. This approach consists in using idle resources of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world to solve large computational problems such as the generation of long molecular simulations. By using this technology, it is possible to generate sufficient computational power to capture critical, and still undefined, biological events. The generation of such detailed simulations and its comprehensive analysis can revolutionize our understanding on GPCR signalling by providing unprecedented insights into its dynamics. In our group we have started the ambitious project of creating a new distributed computing platform focused on the study of GPCRs involved in neurodegenerative diseases (www.brainstormathome.wordpress.com). A very important part of this project involves the development of a database that stores the data being generated in our platform and a website that displays such data. Another objective of the website is to present our project to potential volunteers, so it should be an engaging site that makes an impact to the users and motivates people to join our project. If there is enough time and the student is interested, he/she can also have a role in other parts of the project such as the analysis of the obtained data or programming workunits that will run on the volunteers’ computer. We expect that this platform will have a strong impact on our understanding of GPCRs and will lead to publication in a high impact journal. The project can be extended into a PhD thesis.  	www.brainstormathome.wordpress.com	HTLM/CSS and web page design, MySQL 5.5 and database design, Python.  C/C++ and JavaScript is a plus.

They are present in almost every type of cell, and govern almost every process in the human body (i.e. cognitive and inflammatory processes or control of the cardiovascular system). Owning to their ubiquity, they are targets of more than 30% of current drugs, and every day new GPCRs are revealed to be pharmacological targets for existing diseases. GPCR drugs can either be agonist, antagonist or inverse agonists. They act by binding to the receptor and establishing transient interactions with protein residues that form the binding pocket. Those interactions alter the GPCR structure, leading to a specific downstream signalling response.  However, important features responsible for a distinct drug profile (selectivity, signalling outcome, etc.) are still unclear. Uncovering those factors would provide important structural insight for further drug-design endeavours. Currently, there exist multiple GPCR structures bound to various ligands (chemicals binding to GPCRs), however a static look at ligand-receptor interactions doesn’t allow to fully rationalize the signalling profile.  Molecular dynamics (MD) is a novel and sophisticated technique that enables to simulate protein behaviour in a physiological environment. They offer a unique opportunity to study GPCR-ligand interactions at single atom resolution, providing insights on receptor behaviour. The development of MD techniques has been rewarded with a Nobel Prize in 2013, and the number of papers using MD is growing exponentially. In our group we have carried out a massive MD projects to unravel general principles of GPCR signalling. With the aid of an international consortium we have simulated over 90 GPCRs crystallized with diverse ligands, amounting impressive simulation time.  We have two Master positions for motivated students that would be interested in participating in the analysis of this data. The students would be involved in analysing the generated MD data. During the project they will learn how to set up, and simulate their own biological systems. They will learn about GPCR biology, as well as about in silico drug design. To analyse the data the students will learn to write in house scripts in tcl, bash and python, as well as use several statistical methods. The student will have the opportunity to collaborate with international experts renowned in the GPCR field (members of the consortium). We expect that the results of the analysis will be published in a high impact journal, and the skills acquired by the student will make him/her a valuable asset for pharma companies. The project can be extended into a PhD thesis. 	https://selentlab.wordpress.com/ www.gpcrmd.org	Experience in structural biology, python, and bash.

The main objectives are: 1) to improve the genetic diagnosis of these nephropathies, improving the genomic analysis using NGS data obtained from a panel of >250 genes causative of IKD and obtaining a more complete genetic information for a better understanding of inter and intrafamilial variability; 2) to identify new genes responsible for these diseases using whole exome and whole genome sequencing data. Beyond the exposed scientific goals, the student will also be dealing with the implementation and improvement of basic bioinformatic pipelines that the Fundació Puigvert (FP) is currently  using, including programs like, SAM tools, BWA-mem, GATK, Annovar, among others. The solid collaboration of the FP and the BSC offers, through this project, a combined training environment that includes diagnostic in genetics, as well as clinical bioinformatics. This training can be useful to students with biological background and some basic bioinformatic skills, as well as for students with a computational background that want to widen their knowledge in genomics medicine.  METHODOLOGY:  We have the 250-kidney gene panel NGS data from 1000 patients with IKD, 60% of them with the causative mutation identified. Current sequence analysis methods used for diagnosis in FP include programs for the identification of variants from the sequencing of gene panels. Our current aim and direction in our unit is to start including the analysis of exomes to be able to expand our search to other genes that are not listed as known causative genes of nephropathies, and with that, improve our diagnosis possibilities. The transition from gene panels to exomes require to start considering other types of variant callers, as well as other computing requirements. The tasks around this activity will involve the implementation and testing of pipelines for the identification of rare variants (single nucleotide variants, and small indels) in exomes of non-diagnosed patients.  The group has already generated 50 exome sequences from patients and this number will increase in the following months. The computational work will be done in collaboration with the group of Computational Genomics (David Torrents) at the BSC, which is already implementing these solutions within similar initiatives and projects with other clinical partners.

16/03/2018 12:50:19	jana.selent@upf.edu	Jana Selent	IMIM	https://selentlab.wordpress.com/	Towards understanding signaling bias at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) 	G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most abundant class of receptors in the human organism. They are present in almost every type of cell, and govern almost every process in the human body (i.e. cognitive and inflammatory processes or control of the cardiovascular system). Owning to their ubiquity, they are targets of more than 30% of current drugs, and every day new GPCRs are revealed to be pharmacological targets for existing diseases. GPCRs can initiate signalling through binding with several intracellular partners, which in turn elicit distinct signalling cascades. It is established that in physiological conditions, a receptor binds to each of the partners in equal proportion. Interestingly some drugs alter the GPCR structure, so that it preferentially binds to one agent. Such ligands, named biased ligands offer great promise, as they enable to modify pathways associated with symptoms, while not modifying other pathways. However, the molecular requirements for a molecule to act as a biased agonist within a receptor are still poorly understood.  Molecular dynamics (MD) is a novel and sophisticated technique that enables to simulate protein behaviour in a physiological environment. This technique offers a unique opportunity to study changes in receptor structure in response to various stimuli (ligand binding, mutations) at a single atom resolution. The development of MD techniques has been rewarded with a Nobel Prize in 2013, and the number of papers using MD is growing exponentially. In our group we attempt to understand signalling bias in GPCRs using MD. It is our understanding that residues within the receptor form a complex signalling network. Our collaborators have generated multiple mutant receptors, to study how disturbances of this network affect the signalling response. We aim to simulate all of those mutants, to find common structural events that are connected to a distinct signalling response (i.e. finding common receptor structural rearrangements connected to a bias towards pathway A).  We have a Master position for a motivated student that would be interested in participating in this project. The student would be involved in setting up the simulated systems, and carrying out the simulations. Afterwards the student will be involved in the analysis of data, which ultimately will lead to a structural functional map of signalling bias. During the project the student will learn how to set up, and simulate their own biological systems. They will learn about GPCR biology, as well as about in silico drug design. To analyse the data, the student will learn to write in house scripts in tcl, bash and python, as well as to use several statistical methods. If the student generates hypothesis they can be verified by mutational experiments (carried out by our collaborators), and enhanced sampling methods (metadynamics). We expect that the results of the analysis will be published in a high impact journal, and the skills acquired by the student will make him a valuable asset for pharma companies. The project can be extended into a PhD thesis.  	https://selentlab.wordpress.com/ www.gpcrmd.org	Experience in structural biology, python, and bash.

The power of new technologies such as whole genome/exome sequencing is rapidly changing the concept of leukemia evolution, as well as the possibility to predict patient outcome and response to particular treatments at early stages of the disease.  This project aims to identify new mechanisms of resistance by using whole exome sequence (WXS) of matched DNA from adult T-ALL samples at diagnosis, remission and relapse. We will use powerful in-house designed software (Oncodrive methods) to uncover mutations driving tumor progression/maintenance, and those driving the process of resistance, which will be functionally validated in the appropriate genetic animal models and patient-derived xenografts. The use of both in vivo models provide the unique opportunity of analyzing specific mutations in 2 different contexts: 1) bona-fide human leukemic cells containing different accompanying mutations and 2) a mouse “clean” leukemic context in which only specific (selected) mutations are present. Finally, in a long-term project we will evaluate pediatric T-ALL samples for the presence of specific and common driver and resistance-associated mutations that may explain the poorer outcome of adult patients, but also provide potential therapeutic strategies for pediatric high-risk groups.  Previous genomic data obtained from several leukemic/cancer models indicate that mutations found at relapse were already present at diagnosis in variable frequencies. In this context, increasing the sensibility of detection for driver and resistance-related mutations at the time of diagnosis is crucial for patient stratification and treatment protocol selection. With this objective, we will perform high-depth sequencing of particular resistance-related mutations identified in the first part of the project in all diagnosis samples initially classified as negative. We will use a minimum of 100 samples to increase the chance of identifying rare pre-existing subclones and to obtaining enough statistic significance in terms of predicting relapse or therapy response.

Apoptosis plays a critical role during development and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Deregulation of the cell mechanisms leading to apoptosis contributes to many major diseases such as cancer1,2 or viral infections3.  The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a key role in the control of apoptosis. Bcl-2 family members possess at least one of the four conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains designated BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4, and can be classified as anti- or apoptotic proteins depending on their ability to suppress or induce apoptosis, respectively. Many of the antiapoptotic members, as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1, show four domains of sequence homology (BH1 to BH4). In contrast, some proapoptotic proteins such as Bad4, Bid or Bim, have only the BH3 domain whereas others, like Bax or Bak display sequence conservation in all four domains. Although further work is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms regulating Bcl-2 family proteins, the dimerization between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins determine cell fate5.  Activation of Bak or Bax or even both is absolutely required for the initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. A small subset of BH3-only proteins (tBid, a truncated form of Bid, Bim and possibly Puma; the literature is conflicting for the last one) has been shown to activate Bak/Bax to initiate mitochondrial outer membrane permiabilization (MOMP)6,7. However, the mechanism by which these BH3-only proteins activate these proapoptotic effectors to promote apoptosis has been one of the most debated topics in apoptosis research. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that binding of Bid (BH3), Bim(BH3) or of a small-molecule (BAM7) to α1/α6 of Bax is sufficient to promote the functional homo-oligomerization of the protein and subsequent apoptosis8,9, providing a new strategy for pharmacological induction of apoptosis. In this scenario, the proposed workplan is as follows: 1. Identification of selective Bax activators. In contrast to Bak, the presence of an additional BH3-binding site in Bax opens the possibility to design compounds able to bind selectively to this protein inducing its activation. To this aim, in a previous work, the NMR structure of Bax in complex with Bim(BH3) (PDB Id. 2K7W9) was used as starting point to carry out different molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to study the Bax-Bim(BH3) interaction at an atomic level and to identify the protein-peptide interacting residue pairs that contribute to the stability of the complex by electrostatic and van der Waals interaction. The position that groups of the peptide found critical for its interaction with the protein (pharmacophoric points) adopts along the trajectory were used to define a “dynamic pharmacophore”, which account for the inherent flexibility of the protein and the peptide in the complex. 1.1: Pharmacophore-based virtual screening. This dynamic pharmacophore will be used to screen free databases of commercially available compounds such as ZINC (http://zinc.docking.org/)  or DrugBank (www.drugbank.ca), marketd drugs and fragments of this drugs. This procedure will allow us to propose new-classes of selective Bax activators. 1.2: Docking. Compounds retrieved via the pharmacophoric hypothesis will be subjected to docking studies to ensure that they fit the binding site of Bax. The top-ranked compounds will be re-scored using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson Boltzman/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-PB/GBSA) methodology and different scoring functions. Finally, the best poses will be refined and analyzed to ensure that they have with the protein the interactions found critical in the Bax-Bim(BH3) complex. 2. Identification of the binding site of BAM7. At the same time, different molecular dynamics for the system Bax-BAM7 will be done in order to determine the binding site of the previously commented Bax activator. The recently described Gaussian Accelerate Molecular Dynamics ( GAMD) will be used to clearly determine the binding site of this ligand. Once the binding site is determined we will proceed to look for other compounds that produce the same interactions. 	References: 1.

This project will focus on TDP-43, a protein implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and on the effect that pathological mutations have on the physical states that the protein can acquire. We have developed a method that makes use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to measure both aggregation and fitness effects of thousands of protein variants at the same time. By this means, we have collected sequencing data that will allow us to identify the most toxic variants of the protein and build hypothesis on the mechanisms behind such effect.The project involves processing and analysis of DNA sequencing of big mutational libraries, followed  by statistical analysis of the data.We will then use a set of bioinformatic tools available to characterise the properties associated with the most toxic protein variants.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27545621 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317470 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/08/230987.full.pdf	R, biostatistics, basic scripting skills (BASH, Perl)	To be discussed	Computational systems biology	protein aggregation, mutational landscape	To be discussed		Benedetta Bolognesi					https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHLuk6xo-tJ7kJPk36MADIBDESPdjel5Wrp-EBsi9IkzezSg/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnuewpKMGo_qgP7hGUHXZ0OqiAMquBzT3YS8A9I65mwwXLPbAs9yS_bucQQ

At present, a number of inhibitors, both antibodies against MET or its ligand hepatocyte growth factor, and small molecule MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials. Novel variants of MET have been discovered which are expressed in 6% of high-grade gliomas.  On the one hand, characterization of these mutations in a glioma cell line revealed that it consists of an intronic deletion, resulting in a splice event connecting an intact splice donor site in exon 6 with the next splice acceptor site being that of exon 9. The encoded protein lacks parts of the extracellular IPT domains 1 and 2, encoded by exons 7 and 8, resulting in a novel pseudo-IPT and is named MET(Δ7-8). MET(Δ7-8) is located predominantly in the cytosol and is constitutively active. On the other hand, recurrent somatic splice site alterations have been studied at MET exon 14 ( MET ex14) that result in exon skipping and MET activation have been characterized, but their full diversity and prevalence across tumor types are unknown.Testing of MET-expressing tumors for the presence of this variant may be important for treatment decision making. A hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) competitive Met antagonist could inhibit the receptor activation and proliferation in tumor cells harboring the Met deletion, suggesting the important role played by ligand-dependent Met activation and so the potential for anticancer therapy. MET inhibition functions would include proliferation, migration/motility, and angiogenesis. So MET is becoming a promising, novel target for NSCLC and combination approaches with cisplatin or EGFR inhibitors should be explored. For this project, we have FFPE's samples of patients with NSCLC and tissue of E98 cell lines which comes from a European Project. The objective of these project is to determine whether FFPE's samples of NSCLC show similar genomic patterns as those found into patients with glioma affecting IPT domains or the final helix. Later, we could analyse the expressión changes in order to know if possible existing inhibitors could be applied in this type of tumoral cells, too.

Compound data is scattered and diverse, making it inaccessible to most researchers and not suited for standard analyses. We have recently developed the Chemical Checker (CC), a framework to digest and organize publicly-available compound bioactivities and express them in a vector form that can be used out-of-the-box in daily computational drug discovery tasks (Duran-Frigola et al. Cell – Under review). The CC divides data in five levels of increasing complexity, from the chemical properties of molecules to their clinical outcomes. Among others, we include targets, off-targets, perturbed biological networks and cell-based gene expression, growth inhibition and morphological profiles. As a result, the first outcome of the CC is a neat portrait of the known bioactivity space of small molecules, quantifying the size and complexity of each data type, and showing remarkable correlations between them. We now offer several projects to exploit the power of the CC by measuring and inferring similarities between compounds, moving from the traditional comparison of chemical structures to considering all the amassed biological data. These six-month projects could promptly achieve a number of drug discovery tasks, such as library optimization, mimicking and reversion of transcriptional signatures, ranking of drug combinations, and anticipation of drug failure in clinical trials.

In the same way that two chemical fragments are considered bioisosteric if they can bind to the same protein environment, two protein environments will be considered chemoisosteric if they can interact with the same chemical fragment. The basis for the identification of chemoisosteric relationships among protein environments was the increasing amount of crystal structures available currently for protein−ligand complexes.   The potential applicability of chemoisosterism in fragment-based drug discovery is straightforward. In fact, we were able to show that one can recover the right location and orientation of chemical fragments constituting the native ligand in a nuclear receptor structure by using only chemoisosteric environments present in enzyme structures [1].  Therefore, the main objective of this project will be to apply the concept of chemoisosterism to identify druggable protein-protein and allosteric binding sites in all protein entries deposited currently in the Protein Data Bank. This large-scale prediction of chemical fragments in non-canonical protein binding sites will allow for designing new ligands that could be purchased or synthesized and subsequently tested to confirm the predictions.

Since small molecules are usually not screened systematically through a large panel of proteins for the sake of acquiring knowledge about their complete pharmacological profile but solely to the few targets of interest for the particular project at work, interaction data stored in public sources (such as ChEMBL, BindingDB, and IUPHARdb, among others) are largely incomplete and biased towards targets of common therapeutic relevance [1,2].   The main objective of this focused project will be to perform a completeness analysis of all ligand-protein interaction data available to identify the most complete interaction matrices from public sources (CIMPS). These CIMPS will be ultimately put in the public domain with the idea that the entire scientific community can use them to test the performance of computational methods to predict the complete pharmacological profile of small molecules [3], an aspect of utmost importance in our ability to better anticipate drug safety [4].

Our research group is a National and European referent in the research of these rare liver tumors and our recent efforts have been focused to identify new prognostic biomarkers by performing a comprehensive molecular characterization of childhood liver cancer by using 4 different techniques (RNA-seq, HTA, EPIC and CytoSCAN arrays). The main objective of this master project is to perform an integrative study of our recently generated transcriptomic data in childhood liver cancer with the public available adult liver cancer data  in order to define similarities and differences of genes, regulators and pathways between liver cancer developed at different ages.

Despite the huge number and of PPIs and their relevance in some disorders, there are very few examples of drugs that are able to successfully modulate them. This is mostly due to the extended and flat surfaces involved in PPIs, which make them challenging for targeting by conventional drugs. In contrast to small organic molecules, designed peptides (often featuring non-natural amino acids), are modular structures, with a higher degree of flexibility, which can better adapt to irregular protein surfaces. These features, among others, have recently stimulated research into the development of therapeutic peptides for the selective targeting of proteins that are involved in disease. In this project, the student will use computational tools for the design of new peptides that are able to bind protein surfaces and modulate therapeutically relevant PPIs.	S. Guardiola, J. Seco, M.

During the last 3 years, we have implemented genetic diagnosis on families affected by leukodystrophies and spastic paraplegias, two overlapping groups of diseases showing a high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Nowadays, we have access to clinical records, samples, and NGS data from more than 200 different families, in constant growth. However, the genetic background of these diseases is only partly understood, and more than 30% of patients remain without a genetic diagnosis. We intend to improve the identification of causative variants in known HSP/leukodystrophy genes, as well as finding novel candidate genes.  We seek a student to work in a bioinformatics project in which we aim to 1) apply prioritisation algorithms for disease gene identification using whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from a well-defined patient cohort; and 2) to develop and exploit in-house bioinformatics tools to sort out hard-to-find pathogenic variants. Methods used during this project will include genome/exome NGS annotation, variant prioritisation algorithms, and big data treatment (parallel computing, database management).
