Despite that modern high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are currently accessible for many labs, the accurate identification and annotation of gene family is one of the major challenges in the field. This scenario will change in the near future thanks to the irruption of the so called third-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., long-read sequencing). Currently, our research group generates genomic and transcriptomic data of spiders (Chelicerata), to generate chromosome-level assemblies using long reads DNA sequence data, and Omni-C based scaffolding.
The objective of this TFM is to perform a comparative genomic study of the molecular evolution of 1) the major gene families involved in the chemosensory system (olfactory and gustatory), or 2) those encoding venoms and toxins or 3) the repetitive elements (transposable or other types of repetitive sequences) in chelicerates and, by extension, in arthropods. This research has very relevant biological characteristics with many applications, beyond evolutionary biology. For the analysis, we are using comparative genomics and transcriptomics approaches, under the theoretical framework of molecular evolutionary genetics to identify the genomic regions and gene functions driving diversification. We applied powerful bioinformatics tools to detect changes in coding and non-coding regions, in gene copy number, and in gene expression levels associated with speciation processes.

The student will participate in the assembly, annotation and analysis in several spiders (and chelicerates) species. For that, he/she will use high quality genome/transcriptome data (generated by our group based on third generation sequencing technologies, and sequences already available in databases), bioinformatics tools (software and scripts to manipulate and visualizte sequences and genomic annotations, to identify repetitive elements, to conduct evolutionary genetics analyses). The basic work-flow will consist in the identification and primary annotation of repeats, the determination of families, types and classes, the estimation of gene turnover rates, or the characterization of the distribution of these repetitive sequences across chromosomes, or across other genomic elements, such as protein-coding genes. Many of these analyses will be carried out in our high performance computer cluster.

Substantial evidence shows that SVD and Alzheimer’s disease share risk factors and have additive, if not synergetic, effects on cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Yet, the intersection between SVD and AD pathophysiological processes remains unclear. Consequently, a proper understanding of how SVD exerts its action on the aging brain, interacts with Alzheimer’s disease, and leads to clinical symptoms is urgently needed. In the present project, we will focus on one specific radiological markers of SVD: the cerebral microbleeds. Microbleeds are small hypointense lesions that are visible on paramagnetic-sensitive MR sequences such as susceptibility-weighted sequence (SWI). These lesions correspond to haemosiderin-laden macrophages in perivascular tissue, consistent with vascular leakage of blood cells. Cerebral microbleeds are frequently found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease but their specific relationship with the disease processes remains debated. The aim of the current project is therefore to better characterize the emergence of cerebral microbleeds in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, and delineate their effect on the neuronal loss and cognitive impairment. For this, the candidate will use and manipulate the MRI data (T1, T2, SWI) of >150 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and genetic Alzheimer's disease (i.e., patient with Down Syndrome). Specifically, the master student will: i) Familiarize with Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology in a highly interdisciplinary  environment. ii) Learn about brain image processing tools and perform analyses in regions of interest and/or voxelwise. iii) Implement different methods to segment cerebral microbleeds and compare their application in the context of Down syndrome and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. iv) Familiarize with statistical approaches to assess the relationships between cerebral microbleeds, other neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive data.","(1) Wardlaw, J.

Transcriptional regulatory elements in complex genomes are key players of the genome during development, cell and tissue homeostasis, responses to external stimuli, and disease. Highthroughput experiments of genomics and proteomics have provided a plethora of activating regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers, of the genome. However, very few proteins in human occupy most of their motif matches under physiological conditions, which highlights the importance of the balance between the co-operativity of transcription factors (TFs), their strength upon binding and the environment (such as chromatin state and epigenetic marks). Co-operative recognition of DNA by multiple TFs defines unique genomic positions on the genome and confers a robust regulation. Most eukaryotic TFs recruit cofactors as ‘‘coactivators’’ or ‘‘corepressors’’ forming large complexes formed by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to regulate transcription. Of particular interest is the co-operation of “pioneer factors” (the first to engage target sites in chromatin, culminating in transcription by displacing nucleosomes). Protein-DNA binding strength has been of extraordinary importance for understanding co-operativity and transcription regulation. Variable TF-DNA interactions are increasingly considered as key drivers of phenotypic
variation. Overall, about 19% of the human TFs are currently associated with at least one
phenotype and a significant number of mutations associated with diseases are within or near genes encoding TFs. In the last years, different models for representing TF motifs, such as machine learning models combining multiple layers of genomic, transcriptomic, DNase hyper-sensitivity (DHS) and epigenomic information, were developed to score new putative regulatory sequences or calculate the 'gainability' and 'disruptability' of Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) alleles. The strength of binding of TFs may not only be affected by mutations, but also by epigenetic modifications of chromatin, such as methylation of cytosine bases. With the emergence of new methods to outline DNA binding, methylation was found to be abundant throughout the genome except at active regulatory regions bound by TFs, such as gene promoters and distal enhancers. There are also few examples where modification of a single CpG dinucleotide directly affects transcription factor binding and regulation of a target gene in vivo.

The Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) aims to sequence, catalog and characterize the genomes of all of Earth’s eukaryotic biodiversity over a period of 10 years (http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4325).  The outcomes of the EBP will inform a broad range of major issues facing humankind, such as the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the conservation of endangered species and ecosystems, and the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services. It will contribute to our understanding of biology, ecology and evolution, and will facilitate advances in agriculture, medicine and in the industries based on life: it will, among others, help to discover new medicinal resources for human health, enhance control of pandemics, to identify new genetic variants for improving agriculture, and to discover novel biomaterials and new energy sources, among others.
The value of the genome sequence depends largely on the precised identification genes. The aim of the research project is to develop a gene annotation pipeline that produces high quality gene annotations that can be efficiently scaled to more than one million species. Our group has a long-standing interest in gene annotation. Roderic Guigo developed one of the first computational methods to predict genes in genomic sequences (geneid, Guigó et al, 1992), which has been widely used to annotate genomes during the past years. On the other hand, we are part of GENCODE, which aims to produce the reference annotation of the human genome. Within GENCODE we have developed experimental protocols to efficiently produced full-lengh RNA sequences.
Our pipeline will be based on identifying the genes that can be precisely predicted computationally in a given species, subtract them from RNA samples, and produced high quality RNA sequences for the genes that are more difficult to annotate.

Here, we will use a sophisticated food addiction mouse model. In this model, we measure 3 addiction criteria for the diagnosis of the disease and 4 phenotypic traits suggested as predisposing factors related to vulnerability to addiction. Also, it is possible to evaluate the long food addiction mouse model with mice genetically modified. We target the endocannabinoid system, with specific mutations in CB1 receptor. Importantly, the novelty of this protocol is the adaptation of this food addiction model to a short protocol to evaluate genetic manipulations targeting specific brain circuitries by using a chemogenetic approach that could promote the rapid development of this addictive behavior. These adaptations lead to a short food addiction mouse protocol, in which mice follow the same behavioral procedure of the early period in the long food addiction protocol with some variations due to the surgical viral vector injection. To our knowledge, there is no paradigm in mice allowing us to study the combination of such a robust behavioral approach that allows uncovering the neurobiology of food addiction at the brain circuit level. We can study using this protocol if modifying the excitability of a specific brain network confers resilience or vulnerability to developing food addiction.

In particular, we are interested in deciphering the evolutionary dynamics of animal cell type programs and in reconstructing the emergence of genome regulatory mechanisms linked to cell type differentiation (from transcription factor binding through chromatin states to the physical architecture of the genome). To this end, we apply advanced single-cell genomics and chromatin experimental methods to molecularly dissect cell types and epigenomic landscapes in phylogenetically diverse organisms. We also develop computational tools to integrate these diverse data sources into models of cell type gene regulatory networks and we use phylogenetic methods to comparatively analyse these models. Our recent work has provided the first whole-organism cell type atlases in different species and mapped key regulatory genome features underlying these cellular programs. By sampling additional species and chromatin features at single-cell resolution, we now aim at dissecting the evolution of cell types and their underlying gene regulatory networks.

We are seeking highly motivated master students to join our team and work on inferring and comparing cell type gene regulatory networks (GRNs) across species.

Gelsolin (GSN) is the prototype of a family of Ca2+ dependent proteins that regulate actin oligomerization state through their severing, capping and nucleating activities. Due to this polyvalent function and modular construction, gelsolin-like proteins are involved in several physiological processes. However, an exhaustive model of its physiologic mechanism of action is not yet available due to the highly dynamic structures of both gelsolin and actin.

This project aims to develop a robust model of GSN activation by combining experimental and computational approaches. We will use extensive (""big data"") molecular dynamics simulations with state-of-the art methodologies to elucidate the rare events and pathways underlying state transitions that are both physiologically relevant for the maintenance of the cell cytoskeleton, as well as in the pathology of diseases such as AGel amyloidosis.

The work is essentially computational. The student will work with the direction of Dr. T. Giorgino [www.giorginolab.it] of the Institute of Biophysics of the Italian National Research Council.

Up to now, this problem has mostly been addressed for proteins having a well-defined three-dimensional form, which represent around 60% of the human proteome. The remaining proportion corresponds to proteins that do not present a stable structure, the so-called Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), but which are nevertheless fully functional and perform essential tasks. Due to their flexibility, the structural investigation of IDPs is extremely challenging, and requires a tight combination of experimental and computational methods. Reliable and accurate methods to characterize and compare conformational ensemble models is a key component in this context. For instance, they are required to quantify structural effects of mutations, or to assess the quality of molecular dynamics simulations.

Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of IDPs, novel methods to analyze their structural properties have to be conceived from a statistical point of view. The MoMA team at LAAS-CNRS (Toulouse, France)is currently collaborating on this topic with the Institute of Mathematics of Toulouse. More precisely, they are developing a statistical comparison tool, based on recent advances in Optimal Transport Theory, as well as unsupervised learning methods for data supported on non-euclidean spaces. A first prototype has been successfully implemented in R. However, the required computations being expensive, a more efficient and user-friendly implementation is needed in order to make this tool available to the Structural Biology community. The aim of this project is to properly implement such methods in Python, creating a ready-to-use tool adapted to the format and structure of protein data which is used in this community. We expect that this project will lead to a scientific publication.

Abril,Computational Genomics Lab @ UB,Universitat de Barcelona,https://compgen.bio.ub.edu/,Computational genomics,Computational analysis of nanopore-sequencing metagenomic samples to discover and track potential pathogenic viral species.,"Metagenomics approaches based on high-throughput sequencing help us to characterize the microbe and viral communities on a wide variety of samples. They can be used as diagnostic tools to detect the presence of a known organism, which can be pathogenic or not, as well as to determine candidate novel sequences for previously unreported species (Martínez-Puchol et al, 2020; Rusiñol et al, 2020; Hjelmsø et al, 2017). Regarding the zoonotic phenomenon, it is known that bats are the origin of recent epidemics caused by Coronaviridae, like SARS and MERS genera, in human populations (Anthony et al. 2017). Several studies on viral diversity in bat feces/oral samples using metagenomics have provided better information than previous analyses using conventional molecular methods (Hardmeier et al, 2021; Lee et al, 2020; Donaldson et al, 2010).
Different methodologies can be used to obtain the samples that will be sequenced later on, each of them focusing on different facets of the genomes biology, but also implying different post-processing of the reads delivered by the sequencing technologies. Three main approaches can be considered: 1) whole-genome shotgun approaches, where the focus is to retrieve as many species genomes as possible and attempt to reconstruct the chromosomes, and run phylogenetic analyses to describe the taxonomic units (OTUs) composition; 2) targeted sequencing, based on enriching the samples for specific groups by using sets of proves designed to capture the sequences of interest, which can provide finer resolution to annotate variants or diverging sequences between species; 3) amplicon sequencing, where paired primer sequences delimiting a genomic segment facilitate the enrichment of that region by PCR amplification. In all those cases the resulting fragments (at read, contig, scaffold or chromosome level) can be used for phylogenetic analyses,
to characterize the species composition and to discover related novel species. The sequences can be also used to annotate allelic variants that can be relevant to understand the evolution of the viral species, as well as to assess the nucleotide positions that may have an impact at phenotypic level (single nucleotide variants or insertion/deletion events); which can result in increased/decreased transmissibility, antigenicity, or pathogenicity; all those having a role in disease severity, as it has been reported for SARS-Cov-2 (Callaway, 2020; Li et al, 2021; Harvey et al, 2021). The impact of the detected mutations on pathogenicity can be estimated on those sequences (Gussow et al, 2020); for instance, in order to predict if novel related species detected in human and animal samples have enough zoonotic potential to infect humans and become a source of novel pandemic events.
High-throughput sequencing on short reads can still provide insights of population variants of concern that may lead to the rise of novel lineages (Smyth et al, 2022), yet amplicon sequencing still poses some issues in the reconstruction of the phases of variants that fall outside overlapping fragments of tiled sets of amplicons, like those produced by the SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC set (Rambaut, 2020), as well as presenting some biases with the sampling of single nucleotide variants falling within the primers complementary genomic region
(Kuchinsk et al, 2022) and indels (Brandt et al, 2021). Long-read nanopore sequencing will pave the way to easily decipher allelic combinations that can result in better characterization of viral strains (Tyson et al, 2020). There are different approaches to take into account the higher error rates at nucleotide level still produced by nanopore sequencing that require deeper coverage to obtain reliable phasing clusters (Schrinner et al, 2020). Taking all of this in consideration, we must delineate how to process the sequences obtained from the ongoing research projects, and must look for solutions to address some of the already described issues that we found also in our sequencing data sets. This master project project will focus on the computational characterization of the genomic sequences of viral species that can be found on a variety of matrices, from wastewater to clinical samples.","Anthony S.J, et al. “PREDICT Consortium.

In recent years, the idea that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may be a genetically-driven synaptic failure is gaining traction [1]. As such, identification of the genetic variants that regulate an individual’s vulnerability to AD-related synapse degeneration could be used by clinicians to identify individuals at-risk for AD prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms.

Although over 40 genetic loci associated with altered risk of developing AD have been identified to-date [2], these loci cannot not explain the entire genetic component of AD and suggest a substantial ‘missing heritability’ [3]. The complex nature of AD, presupposes that the genetic component is likely to be a result of the combined effect of many loci [4], which can be estimated by generation of a polygenic risk score (PRS) [5-7]. Several studies have reported PRS with good accuracy to predict LOAD [8-11]. However, the reported PRS are typically comprised of hundreds or even thousands of loci, thereby limiting their utility as an early screening tool to identify individuals at high-risk for developing AD.

We hypothesized that variability in genes that encode proteins integral to synaptic function may be enriched for genetic variants that modify AD risk. To test this hypothesis we generated a PRS restricted to genetic variants that reside within synapse-encoding genes [12] using summary statistics from a large meta-analysis of GWAS [2] that included 74,046 subjects and 7,055,881 genetic variants. The best “synaptic PRS” comprised just 8 SNPs from 6 genes predicted AD with 72-73% accuracy in two cohorts of neuropathologically confirmed AD, thus representing the simplest model with good accuracy to predict AD.

A network analysis of the proteins encoded by the 6 genes divided the proteins into two highly inter-related clusters related to glutamate signalling or APP catabolism and tau protein binding, processes that are so fundamental to early AD pathophysiology that they are the target of therapies already prescribed for the treatment of AD symptoms (e.g., blockade of NMDA-mediated glutamate signaling) or are the target of drugs currently in ongoing AD clinical trials (Aβ and tau accumulation). This gives the synaptic PRS a strong biological basis. Essentially, these data suggest that genotyping just 8 variants, the synaptic PRS could be used to identify individuals at risk of AD before symptom onset.

MSC Project Aims
a) To provide further validation for the synaptic PRS in a larger, independent cohort of clinically diagnosed AD and cognitively normal controls.

b) To study the effect of the top AD-associated synaptic variants (independently and in combination as PRS) on cognitive, neuroimaging and CSF biomarker presentation in AD patients.

MSc Project Work Plan
This is a multimodal translational study in sporadic and genetic forms of AD and cognitively normal controls. The candidate will gain experience in management of large genetic and clinical datasets, quality control and statistical analysis (regressions, correlations, receiver operating characteristic curves) and use of the latest software (PLINK, PRSice, Freesurfer) and programming tools (Rstudio). The specific tasks include:
•	Extract genotype data from genome-wide arrays using PLINK software (up to 50.000 subjects).
•	Calculate the synaptic PRS using PRSice-2 software using the β-statistic in the reference genome-wide association study stage 1 meta-analysis to generate weighting estimates for each variants.
•	Compare mean synaptic PRS (two-tailed Students T test) and variance in PRS scores (Levene’s Test) between AD and controls (n=50,000).
•	Determine the accuracy (AUC) of the PRS models to predict AD using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in R (pROC package).
•	Compare AUC between models using DeLong’s test
•	Calculate the optimal cut-off using Youden's index, balancing specificity and sensitivity to discriminate AD and controls (cutpointr package in R).

However, these mechanisms rely on protein structures and conformational dynamics that are often unknown. The complexity of the protein machinery involved, and fast cycles of assembly-activity-disassembly have prevented full understanding of the molecular basis that control human biology. For instance, in our group, we investigate the mechanism that drives exocytosis, a process that is essential in neurobiology and cell growth and whose mechanism of action is a long standing question in the field. We have developed a new method of fluorescent microscopy capable to resolve the 3D architecture of protein assemblies directly in living cells. Using this approach and computational integration of structural data we reconstructed de novo the exocytic machinery at the nanometre scale (Picco et al 2017 Cell). Our unpublished data indicates that the exocytic machinery organizes in transient higher-order structures with dimensions similar to the Nuclear Pore Complex, but with a highly dynamic behavior that prevents its purification and reconstitution in vitro. For these reasons, high-resolution structures and conformational dynamics necessary to understand the mechanism of exocytosis remain elusive.
We offer a position for a Master student to continue the work published in Cell (Picco et al 2017 Cell). The student will use IMP (Integrative Modelling Platform, developed in A.

Experimental data in vitro suggest that several proneural factors such as Ascl1, Neurogenin2 and NeuroD1 act as pioneer transcription factors (Raposo et al. 2015; Pataskar et al. 2016). One of the lessons extracted from the reprogramming studies is that pioneer factors poise chromatin for induced pan-neuronal TF factors to bind to newly opened chromatin in combination with pioneer factors (Aydin et al., 2019). It is possible that a similar mechanism takes place during the development of the inner ear neurons; NeuroD might behave as a pioneer factor, open the chromatin and induce the expression of secondary TF that together with NeuroD activate genes of otic neuron differentiation. We have obtained datasets of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq for 3 different neuronal population of cells differentiating in vivo (Neurog1+ cells, NeuroD1+ cells and Islet2b+ cells) in order to assess the changes in the remodelling of the chromatin linked to changes in gene expression during differentiation. The aim of the Project is to analyse these datasets and extract meaningful information of the regulation of chromatin state, the putative transcription factors operating together with NeuroD and identify novel genes expressed in particular timepoints.

The standard treatment for locally advanced disease has been radical cystectomy. While neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves outcomes, it has not been widely adopted because only a subset of patients benefit from it. However, personalized medicine and, specially, immune-based therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors, are rapidly changing the landscape of potential treatments. For example, in 2017 the Food and Drug Administration approved 5 different checkpoint inhibitors for their use in metastatic bladder cancer based on their significant improvement in overall survival. However, the vast majority of patients do not respond to these treatments. Therefore, we need a better understanding of the biological mechanisms so that we can predict the success of these therapies.
While there are some potential biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitors and cisplatin, most have not been formally validated and, in some cases, there is conflicting data. For example, mutations in ERCC2 or other genes of the DNA damage response pathway seem to correlate with better responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the case of checkpoint inhibitors, their success seems to correlate with the tumor mutational burden, albeit there are reports saying the opposite. Interestingly, the presence of CD8 cells in the tumor microenvironment seems to be associated with the success of both types of neoadjuvant therapies, but how, where and why these are recruited to or excluded from the tumor microenvironment is still not completely understood.
To understand the relationship between immune and cancer cells, our group has recently generated a large collection of both, spatial transcriptomics (n = 32) and single-cell RNA (n = 12) libraries from tumor samples of bladder cancer patients. The candidate will integrate these data to identify differences in the spatial location of different immune cell types between patients that did and did not respond to different types of therapies.

Thanks to developments in sequencing-based approaches such as 16S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding, whole genome shotgun sequencing, or meta-transcriptomics, we now can efficiently explore the diversity and roles of oral microbes, even if unculturable. As studies progress, there is increasing evidence of an important role of the oral microbiome in diverse health conditions, which are not limited to diseases of the oral cavity. This, in turn, opens new avenues for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics that benefit from the easy accessibility of the oral cavity for microbiome monitoring and manipulation.

The urge to couple biological data to cutting-edge machine learning has spurred developments in data integration and knowledge representation, especially in the form of heterogeneous, multiplex and semantically-rich biological networks. Today, thanks to the propitious rise in knowledge embedding techniques, these large and complex biological networks can be converted to a vector format that suits the majority of machine learning implementations. Indeed, we have generated biological embeddings (i.e. bioactivity signatures) that capture complex relationships between small molecules and other biological entities such as targets or diseases (1,2). However, only a tiny fraction of the possible chemical space has been so far explored, meaning that most compounds able to modulate biological activities (i.e. drugs) are yet to be discovered. Accordingly, the main objective of this project is to couple our bioactivity signatures to inverse design algorithms to generate new chemical entities with a desired functionality (3). In particular, we aim at generating new chemical entities (NCEs) to modulate the activity of a specific set of targets, selected from a combination of perturbagen profiles, to revert the pathological state induced by Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and other complex disorders (4).

The underlying genetic architecture of common diseases suggests that human diseases are far more linked than previously expected, suggesting substantial pleiotropy between contributing genetic variants, frequently showing opposite directions. These observations together with the evidence that some diseases show high occurrence of comorbidities highlight the need for a genomic approach to identify those at higher/lower risk. It is likely that disease risk alleles can affect patients through intricate pleiotropic relationships increasing or reducing the risk of comorbid diseases, or vice versa, or even affecting their lifespans. Thus, if genetic susceptibility is a potential cause of a comorbid phenotype, the importance of prevention becomes apparent.

The student will use publicly available data from the UKBiobank to improve polygenic score prediction (PRS) for disease trajectories based on genetic profiles. Then, the student will provide proof-of-concept for stratification of patients based on the number (and the effect size) of risk alleles for a given secondary phenotype, also considering existing pleiotropy between traits. As a proof-of-concept, the student will start with investigating comorbidity prediction in psychiatric disorders. This will potentially allow to refine the individual genetic risk for comorbid traits, investigate developmental and gene-environment interplay issues, as well as, ascertaining their lifespan expectation.

These syndromes are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. They are usually monogenic, i.e., caused by mutations in single genes, but affect different tissues, different loci can lead to similar diseases, and, contrarily, the phenotypes and severity can vary considerably across individuals carrying the same mutations.

Genes and proteins do not act isolated but rather interact with each other to perform their functions in molecular complexes, pathways, and other biological processes. Mutations in genes and proteins will thereby affect their interactions and consequently the biological processes in which they are involved. Diseases hence arise from network perturbations, and studying the complex biological networks in which genes and proteins participate is a first step towards better understanding the genotype to phenotype relationships in diseases.

We propose a project in which we aim at systematically identifying the network modules associated with the different PA diseases and their causative genes. The student will hence get familiar with biological networks and graph theory. They will apply different methods from this field, such as random walks or community identification. They will also get their hands on the different types of biological networks, which can better describe the complexity of biological systems, like multiplex or heterogeneous networks. Moreover, the selected candidate will apply the acquired knowledge to a concrete biological question: obtaining new insights about premature aging diseases.

In Janic laboratory we are interested in what are the most important p53 activities needed for tumour suppression. Our hypothesis is that the p53-mediated tumour suppression relies on collective and cooperative activation of the p53 target gene network. To answer this important question, we have conducted functional genomic shRNA and sgRNA screens in vivo to identify p53 target genes whose deficiency can promote tumour development. The E3-ubiquitin ligase RNF, was the most potent hit from our screens. Understanding the mechanisms, by which RNF act in healthy and cancer cells, and how they mediate their tumour suppressive function is the major focus of this project. Our preliminary data shows that RNF deficient cells are aneuploid and have increased DNA damage signalling. In this project we will test if aneuploidy is due to chromosomal instability and genomic alternations using genetically stable RNF deficient cell lines. Karyotype abnormalities observed by an analysis of chromosome spreads will be confirmed by performing low-coverage (shallow) whole genome sequencing to identify copy number alterations and total mutational burden in RNF deficient cells. To achieve better understanding of how large chromosomal changes evolve in our mutants we will isolate genomic DNA for WGS at two timepoints for comparison: the timepoint 0 (T0), on the day when cells will be orthotopically injected into the recipient mice, and at the humane endpoint when mice develop tumours (T1). Shallow sequencing and data analysis will be performed within in-house genomics facility, and data analysis and interpretation of the results by a master student under the co-supervision of Dr Donate Weghorn (CRG) that has extensive expertise cancer genomics. In parallel, master student will quantify chromosomal instability hallmarks of RNF deficient cells: frequency of cells with micronuclei, DNA bridges, multipolar mitosis (gamma-tubulin staining), increased number of centrosomes (gamma-tubulin staining).

Generally considered as an early event in the evolution of a tumor, chromothripsis likely plays a causative role in the development of a number of tumors by generating multiple genomic aberrations simultaneously. In line with this, rearrangements due to chromothripsis were detected in more than 25% of cancer patients in two large pan-cancer studies 3,4. In specific tumor types or molecular subgroups, the prevalence for chromothripsis reaches 100%, such as in medulloblastoma with germline TP53 mutations (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, LFS). Chromothripsis is linked with poor prognosis for these patients, as in a number of other tumor types 5.

Together with collaborators from the Ernst and Stegle labs at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and EMBL in Heidelberg, Germany we have studied the genomic and transcriptomic consequences of genome instability due to chromothripsis 6. We analyzed single-cell genomic and transcriptomic alterations linked with chromothripsis in human p53-deficient medulloblastoma patients. We reconstructed the order of somatic events, identified early alterations likely linked to chromothripsis and depicted the contribution of chromothripsis to malignancy. We characterized subclonal variation of chromothripsis and its effects on double-minute chromosomes, cancer drivers and putatively druggable targets. Furthermore, we highlighted the causative role and the fitness consequences of specific rearrangements in neural progenitors.

We have performed complex analysis to understand the role of chromothripsis using different types of omics data and technologies. Currently there is no public tool to perform chromothripsis analysis automatically in single cell data. The aim of this project is to automatise the analysis that are present in our recent preprint article and to develop an R package (provisionally named as CThripsos) that can be easily applied in a broad range of single cell datasets. We will implement modules to automatise several tasks such as data preprocessing, cleaning of spurious events, clustering of the cells into putative clones, phylogenetic trees inference, detection of clonal and subclonal events, finding of potential therapeutic target genes and gene ontology analysis. You will gain background on cancer genomics and learn how to develop an R package including its documentation and github repository generation. Dr. Parra is an expert in bioinformatics and in the development of computational tools as shown in 7,8 and will support the student at every step of the project. We will collaborate with the group of Dr. Aurelie Ernst, an expert in cancer genomics, at DKFZ, Heidelberg who will help us with the biological questions and hypothesis. We aim that the outcome of CThripsos will be crystallized into an article to be submitted as an application note to a journal like Bioinformatics with the student being one of the major contributors.","1.

Natural proteins fold by minimizing their internal energetic conflicts satisfying the “minimum frustration principle” 1. However, we can find that around 10-15% of the interactions between residues in the native state of proteins are in energetic conflict with their local environment 2. These conflictive interactions, a.k.a frustrated interactions, maintained over evolutionary timescales, are not artifacts but a functional, adaptive response. The reason for this is that “proteins are not optimized to fold but to function”. These energetic conflicts allow proteins to interconvert between the different conformers that constitute their native state and hence perform their function. Local frustration has been linked to many different functional aspects of proteins such as protein-protein interactions 2, allosterism 3, order-disorder transitions 4 or catalytic activity 5, among others.

A method to localize and quantify local frustrated interactions has been publicly available as a web-server since a few years 6 and has recently been implemented as an R package 7. In parallel, we have been developing a strategy that measures the degree of conservation of local frustration within proteins that belong to the same protein family 5,8. The basic idea is that if a given energetic feature, either minimized or in conflict, is conserved across all family members it may hint to a functional requirement of the overall structural architecture of the family. Additionally, if a given energetic feature differs when comparing related subfamilies, it points to a specific adaptation that has occurred in one of the two lineages since they started to diverge from their common ancestor.

The  goal of this project is to contribute to the development of FrustraEvo, a tool to analyze energetic conflicts at protein structures in the context of protein (sub)families and to link them to functional aspects using graph-based approaches, specifically multilayer networks 9. Since most proteins do not have an experimental structure, the candidate will make use of AlphaFold2 to model the missing structures10. We will apply multilayer networks11 to find sets of residues that constitute functional modules related either to protein function or stability. From a higher to a lower level across evolutionary phylogenies, we will find 1) specific features that differentiate related protein families, 2) common features that are shared between all members of a given family, and 3) characteristics that differentiate each protein respect to their family context and make it unique to their respective environment.

We will encode these strategies into specific modules to be included into FrustraEvo and we will apply them to different examples of superfamilies with multiple subfamilies in the context of high interest pathogens or cancer related proteins.

The candidate will be working in collaboration with PhD students and postdocs that are contributing different types of complementary expertise to the overall project. Dr. Parra is an expert in protein biophysics (structures, folding, function) and computational tools development.

Our objective is to identify biomarkers to predict the probability of relapse in children. This knowledge is key because more intensive treatment of high-risk patients could avoid relapse and mortality (note that 20% of relapsing patients survive). We propose to classify cancerous cells using not only their genetic context (SNPs) but also structural variation (translocation, insertions, deletions) and this, by focussing on rearrangements affecting chromatin structure at large scale. In addition, we will provide mechanistic understanding of the pathogenic role of these alterations from the epigenetic point of view. The identification of clones resistant to treatment and the characterization of their chromatin folding, transcriptional profile and gene regulatory landscape will help us understand the origin of sub-clonal resistance to treatment and ultimately to define biomarkers to detect potentially relapsing patients.

This project is grounded on the tight collaboration between the lab of Biola M. Javierre (Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC); https://www.javierrelab.com/; https://www.carrerasresearch.org/), expert in 3D chromatin organization1, providing first hand single-cell data (RNA-seq, CUT&Tag for histone marks and Hi-C) and the lab of Alfonso Valencia (Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC); https://www.bsc.es/valencia-alfonso) specialized in many areas of computational biology focusing on data integration and development of computational frameworks2. This collaboration could help bridge the gap between fundamental research and personalized medicine.

The project will be mainly supervised by François Serra (IJC) an expert in epigenetics and chromatin conformation3, and R. Gonzalo Parra (BSC) expert in single-cell omics4,5, both with experience in mentoring master and PhD students.

Concretely the student will work on the development of a computational pipeline to classify single cells according to the 3D structure of their chromatin and the epigenetic gene regulatory landscape, and relate this classification to other omics data. The first part of the work, that has already started, will consist in generating in silico structural variants data (translocations, duplications, deletions) based on normal single cell data. Analysis will be performed with TADbit3 and the classification will be based on the MERLOT algorithm4. Once optimized with the insilco data, our algorithm will be applied to single cell data produced in the lab as a validation. Concomitantly, we analyze scCUT&Tag data using existing packages6.

Noncoding RNAs are amongst the most fascinating inhabitants of the human genome, and have emerged recently as exciting targets for advanced RNA therapeutics (RNATX). The Laboratory for Genomics of Long noncoding RNAs and Disease (GOLD Lab) aim to understand noncoding RNAs and target them for therapy in oncology. We focus on a particularly fascinating class of RNAs called “long noncoding RNAs” (lncRNAs) that are amongst the most numerous yet least understood. We use an interdisciplinary strategy of computational and experimental approaches, with an emphasis on CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.
In the past decade we have made important contributions, including:
•	Together with international consortia, creating the most accurate maps of lncRNAs;
•	Databases of lncRNAs in cancer and their locations within the cell;
•	Creation of drug screening pipelines for lncRNAs using CRISPR-Cas9, including bioinformatic analysis pipelines;
•	Bioinformatic approaches to predict the regulatory activity of lncRNAs;
•	Analysis of tumour mutation datasets to identify lncRNA drug targets;
•	Development of anti-lncRNA drugs for lung cancer;
We are presently members of two important international consortia, GENCODE and Genomics England.
We can offer a variety of tailor-made projects to interested students. These could be, for example,
•	hypothesis-driven data analysis to make testable predictions about lncRNA functionality;
•	integrative analysis of cancer genomics datasets;
•	creation of pipelines for analysis of next generation sequencing from CRISPR-screens.
More definite project suggestions can be made upon contact with potential students.
Previous UPF students have gone on to publish first-author papers and have successful scientific careers with us and other groups (eg Joana Carlevaro-Fita [bioinformatics specialist, Lausanne], Carlos Pulido-Quetglas [postdoc, Lausanne], David Mas-Ponte [PhD, Barcelona], Andres Lanzos [Startup company, Zurich]).
Students in our lab get exposed to latest bioinformatic and experimental practices on a daily basis. They get closely mentored by a postdoc with degree in Computer Science and have numerous opportunities to present their work internally. Our bioinformaticians use the University College Dublin bioinformatics computing cluster.
The GOLD lab strives to create a warm and supportive environment, where we share passion for RNA and enjoy good company.

The degree of compaction of chromatin affecting a gene promoter dictates accessibility to transcription factors and RNA polymerase, and many chromatin modifying enzyme families act to overcome difficulties imposed by chromatin.
We investigate the role and specificity of histone H1 variants in chromatin organization and gene expression control. By RNA interference of the different human H1 variants we have found that they have different involvement in cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and gene expression. We have also described a differential role of H1 variants in pluripotency and differentiation. Currently, we are investigating the occupancy of H1 variants genome-wide by ChIP-seq (NGS) and the consequences of altering H1 levels on chromatin organization (ATAC-seq, DNA methylation, hiC, etc), with an extensive use of Genomics and Bioinformatics. Additionally, we are performing proteomics of H1 variant specific protein complexes in chromatin and nucleoplasm.

While in some cases the affinity between partners is purely additive, often mutual affinities are extremely affected by the presence of the remaining members of the multicomponent complex. This phenomenon, known as cooperativity (Figure 1), is widespread and impacts many biological processes, yet its molecular determinants are poorly understood.

A relevant case of cooperative effects is the ability of some small molecules to stabilize the interaction between macromolecules, acting as so-called molecular glues. This mechanism is often exploited by nature to modulate biological responses, and a few noteworthy examples (e.g: Lenalidomide, Paclitaxel…) have been developed into drugs. Nevertheless, our lack of understanding of the cooperativity phenomenon has to date prevented the purposeful and reliable development of molecular glues. This research project aims at developing new computational tools that will grant better understanding the cooperativity phenomenon and enable its exploitation for drug design purposes.

The development of small molecules able to selectively trigger protein degradation by hijacking the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) is a frontier challenge in current pharmaceutical sciences. A crucial step for a molecule to trigger protein degradation is to bring the target protein into close proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein in order to be tagged by polyubiquitination and most protein degraders act as cooperative stabilizers of the multicomponent interaction between the substrate protein and the E3 ligase complex. Therefore, only better understand of the cooperativity phenomenon will allow to fully leverage the potential of targeted protein degradation to impact human health.

The magnitude of omics data is a challenge for the mind of any researcher: no human brain can truly grasp datasets comprising thousands of entities (e.g., genes), so that we necessarily rely on computational methods to make sense of data. This is true both for the actual data analysis and for its visualization, essential to summarize and distil data in forms that we can perceive and comprehend.

When the data comes from a multitude of species (which we refer to as “comparative data”), there is an additional complication: the phylogenetic dimension, i.e., the fact that all species are related by a specific tree-like structure called phylogeny. In any analysis of comparative data, phylogeny must be taken into account at all times, since it dictates the fundamental architecture of what we measure (3).

In the lab, we are developing a novel framework for data visualization and analysis oriented to comparative omics, called Treedex (Tree Data explorer). This tool has two main objectives:

•	Facilitate the interactive exploration of comparative data of any magnitude and type, creating an intuitive link between the features under consideration and the phylogeny of species. This will allow studying the evolution at large timescales of many fundamental molecular traits, such gene expression and metabolic regulation.

•	Integrate a wide set of state-of-the-art methodologies from evolutionary/comparative biology, readily available to be applied within Treedex. This “comparative omics toolkit” will mainly focus on methods of evolutionary inference, where we want to discover the hidden functional links among measured features (e.g., reconstructing the functional pathways of genes based on evolutionary patterns). This includes tools such as phylogenetic profiling, protein coevolution finding, phylogenetic regression and many others (4–8).

Treedex is being developed as a module of the ETE4 framework (http://etetoolkit.org/), combined with Plotly/Dash and Pandas (9–11). The students taking part in this project will participate by creating either back-end functionalities (i.e., how evolutionary methods are run under the hood) or working on the front-end (i.e., how plots look like and how user-interaction is implemented). Besides, students will utilize Treedex to analyze actual comparative data, in particular focusing on gene expression across mammals (12–14).

We focus in particular on “recoding” events, programmed exceptions to the genetic code (1). A remarkable example of recoding is stop codon readthrough: a stop codon is recoded to insert an amino acid instead of causing termination of translation. There are ~40 known cases of readthrough in human, 25 of which consist in the insertion of selenocysteine. This special amino acid is encoded by the UGA codon, recoded by a highly regulated mechanism occurring only in specific mRNAs (2).

Due to recoding, genes with readthrough are typically missed or wrongly annotated in genomes, since gene annotation programs only consider canonical rules of translation. Readthrough genes can be identified through protein sequence conservation across multiple species; or using experimental data, in particular ribosome profiling (riboseq). Riboseq is a popular high-throughput technique. It may be considered a variant of RNAseq, in which only the mRNA fragments under active translation are sequenced (3). This invaluable data can inform about diverse forms of translational regulation, including readthrough (4). The student will take on the task of collecting, processing and analyzing riboseq data, to characterize the expression profile of known cases of readthrough and to discover potential new cases.

The lab is interested in understanding how individual variation in gene expression and alternative splicing profiles can explain phenotypic differences between individuals both in the context of health and disease. To address this question, we use large-scale transcriptomic analysis and the latest single-cell sequencing technologies combined with methods development to study gene expression, alternative splicing and cell type composition variation across human tissues and phenotypes.

The goal of this project is to use single-cell transcriptomic analysis to study the regulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are RNAs longer than 200 bp that do not encode for proteins. They differ from mRNAs in that they have lower expression levels, higher tissue specificity and lower splicing efficiency (Melé et al. 2017, Mattioli et al. 2019). LncRNAs play important roles in development, immune response and cancer but for most of them, their mechanism of action remains unknown. We have recently discovered using single-cell expression data that lncRNAs reach expression levels similar to those of protein-coding genes, but they are always present in comparatively fewer cells. This suggests that they have different regulatory mechanisms than protein-coding genes. In this project we will use single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell ATAC-seq data to decipher the mechanisms that govern the expression patterns of protein-coding and lncRNA genes, with an emphasis in unravelling the commonalities and differences between these two gene classes. The results of this project can shed light into our understanding of gene regulatory networks and how lncRNAs operate in health and disease.

In this project, we will apply computer imaging methods on hundreds of human tissue and organ images obtained from healthy donors and donors affected by a wide array of pathologies. The goal is to learn the features from the image data that best allow us to classify individuals based on their phenotype. To do so, we will implement computer vision extraction techniques and classic machine learning approaches to train a support vector machine and predict the phenotypes (such as diabetes and smoking) of individual samples using histopathology images from different human tissues. We will then train convolutional neural networks using our image data with the aim of improving the accuracy of the classifier. Ultimately, our goal is to combine high-throughput transcriptomic data with histopathological tissue images and associate gene expression patterns with macroscopic physiological measurements (cellular phenotypes). In this way, we could pinpoint the  genes responsible for particular disease symptoms, like immune infiltration. To do so, we would extract image features and correlate with gene expression matrices. The results of this project could potentially link expression change to their cellular phenotype and improve our understanding of disease etiology.

In this project, we will perform a large-scale analysis of splicing variation between individuals with different phenotypes and from different ethnic groups. In previous studies, we observed that, in certain contexts, alternative splicing varies more between individuals than between tissues. Also, we have found that ancestry contributes more to explain splicing differences between individuals than other traits such as age. Remarkably, we observe that ribosomal proteins have strikingly large splicing variation between individuals of different ancestries. This pattern could have functional consequences for the translation machinery that we aim to explore further. Ultimately,  the question that we want to tackle in this project is what is the role of alternative splicing in determining  human phenotypic variation.

As a consequence, this results in a single gene coding for multiple proteins or in the possibility to completely abolish the presence of a protein in certain developmental programs or metabolic status.  In metazoans, alterations or malfunctions of alternative splicing (AS) are implicated in disease: a large proportion of human genetic disorders result from splicing variants. Also, it has been shown that AS deregulation contributes to the development of cancer and that splicing factor genes are also frequently mutated in many types of cancer being a major contribution to the development of this disease.
In fission yeast, we have previously shown the existence of a highly specialized splicing program that takes place only in meiosis and that is linked to the speed of the RNA polymerase when transcribing some meiotic genes.  This splicing program is essentially meant as a safe-lock mechanism to ensure the absence of some meiotic proteins during mitotic growth, which otherwise are lethal for the cells.
We have recently done a Nanopore native RNA sequencing which has revealed a myriad of new introns and new mRNA isoforms unknown so far in fission yeast (manuscript under review).  The candidate will combine these new data (data from Alba lab) with RNAseq of synchronous meiosis obtained on an Illumina platform (data from Ayte lab) and will get a full map of the AS events during meiosis.

The paradigmatic example is depicted by the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes, in which loss-of-function mutations are associated with high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Intriguingly, however, women with the same BRCA1/2 mutation, even in the same family, may show very different risk or mutation penetrance. Moreover, some women carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations never develop cancer, which might be due to inheritance of strongly protective alleles in other genes/loci. Identification of these protective alleles will reveal a novel fundamental path to prevent cancer. Here, we propose to identify these alleles by integrating and statistically modeling genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic cancer data.
The student will learn fundamental concepts of cancer risk and biology, multiscale data analyses and integration, and statistical model prediction and associations. The student will be also trained in conceptualization and presentation of data and study design. This proposal is integrated into experimental assays performed at the recipient group.

The candidate will join the area of Precision Medicine in Alfonso Valencia’s Computational Biology group within the Life Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. This research line encompasses the development of different strategies and approaches to improved personalized diagnosis of disease, as well as treatment selection for patients, based on their individual characteristics. Computational systems biomedicine relies on the development of models to integrate different sources of experimental information and produce patient-specific mechanistic explanations of cellular behaviour used to design new targeted therapies. In the context of cancer, cell signalling as well as metabolic models have been reconstructed for different cancer types and healthy tissues. Simulation of these models using different computational approaches (e.g., Boolean formalism, Constraint-Based Modelling) have supported the development of targeted therapies that attack specific biological pathways in the cell.

The candidate will focus on developing a set of tools aimed at the analysis of clinical images to be used in simulations of how cell can resist drug treatments. The focus of present thesis will be to perturb the environmental architecture and initial conditions of different simulations of cancer cells with drugs to find cases where spatial disposition is key to drug resistance emergence.

Scientific context

Understanding drug resistances is a major challenge in biomedicine as the underlying mechanisms are rarely clear and are usually multicausal. Multiscale models that consider several different time and spatial scales have been very helpful to solve different biomedical problems, such as discovering cancer mechanisms [1]. The potential of including Boolean model as gene regulatory networks has opened the way of allowing combined genetic and environmental perturbations [2, 3].

This way, patient-specific dynamical models have been developed to breast-cancer patients leading to the identification of particularities among patients and their clinical stratifications [4]. Currently and in the frame of PerMedCoE project (https://permedcoe.eu/use-cases/), we are using this same framework to obtain cell-line-specific dynamical models and performing simulated drug perturbation studies identifying sets of concentrations where this synergy is maximal and considering population-level constraints and behaviours in prostate patients [3, 5].

Nevertheless and in spite of all these efforts, these simulations have rather simplistic setups and are very far from the complexity found in real tissues [6]. In addition, this complex disposition is important as it is known that cancer disposition causes heterogeneity that underlies the emergence of some resistances [7, 8].

In present project, the candidate will explore the use of clinical data (spatial transcriptomics, anatomopathological images, etc) in combination with computer-aided design tools as a way to have complex environment architectures for a multiscale modelling framework, PhysiBoSS [2], that combines agent-based [9], Boolean [10, 11] and environmental dynamics [12] modelling. These complex setups will be combined with personalisation of genetic regulation networks to have truly personalised simulations [5]. Spatial transcriptomics data from bladder cancer will come from our collaborator Dr Eduard Porta at IJC.
The candidate will first gather data from images and gather information on cell subtypes and localisation that allow for the tailoring of the multiscale simulation to each clinical image. Then, the candidate will build scripts that allow for the mapping of these images to positions for the initial step of the simulations in 2D and aggregating them in 3D stacks with the possibility of combining them with computer-aided design software. The student will need to be able to use the simulation software (in C++) and will be able to use scripts already in place (mostly in python, but also a few in bash, perl and R) and new ones developed by the student to analyse the results of the simulations. At the end of the thesis, the student will have built more realistic simulation environment architectures that help study the emergence of drug resistances by incorporating environmental perturbations to genetic perturbations that could be potentially relevant to the clinic.

We have sequenced more than 200 metagenomes and 50 metatranscriptomes from all the temperate oceans across the globe, with emphasis in the bathypelagic (between 1000 and 4000 m deep), comprising 7 Terabases and 30.000 million read pairs.

This unprecedented dataset has allowed us to generate a marine microbial gene catalog (M-geneDB) of more than 70 milion of distinct genes, many of them with still unknown function. We have also generated a first collection of 317 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep-ocean bacteria and archaea that has allowed us to get a glimpse on the metabolic potential of the keystone prokaryotes in the bathypelagic (Acinas et al., 2021). This unique MAG collection includes potentially chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms - capable to incorporate inorganic carbon in the absence of light, as well as other microorganisms capable of nitrogen fixation - an essential element for life scarce in the ocean. We still don't know how active these microorganisms are in the deep ocean, and therefore their relevance in the biogeochemical cycles as active keyplayers remains unkown. Moreover, these novel genomes represent an unique genetic resource for blue-biotechnology such as unvealing novel CRISPRs-cas9 systems widely used for genome editing. The analysis of the metatranscriptomes of the Malaspina expedition will be crucial to better understand microbial diversity, functioning and blue-biotechnology genetic resources in this unexplored ecosystem on Earth.

The goals of this TFM project would be: 1) to analyze the Malaspina bathypelagic metatranscriptomes, mapping them to the MAG collection and to explore their metabolic activity, 2) to develop a web front-end to query and visualize our MAGs collection from the Malaspina global expedition, 3) to assist in increasing the MAG collection by assemblying, binning and annotating metagenomes.

For instance, dysbiosis in distinct communities has been related to some diseases. Traditionally, studying these populations required the isolation and culture of each individual microorganism, which is a significant limitation considering that small portion prokaryotes are culturable. However, using sequencing technologies allow the study of these populations in a high-throughput manner. These technologies have been essential for the development of metagenomics, which is defined as the culture-independent genomic analysis of all the microorganisms in an environmental niche.

Human microbiomes are taxonomically different whether they come from the gut, skin, vagina or from the mouth. For instance, the genus Bacteroides is very abundant in the gut while it is Lactobacillus in the vagina. Changes in the normal microbiota composition (dysbiosis) have been linked to some diseases such as diabetes (gut), obesity (gut), autism (gut), fertility (vagina), acne (skin), Parkinson (gut), among others. With the analysis of data in order to obtain a taxonomic matrix, the student will develop methods, especially related to machine-learning, that will help doctors to diagnose. Therefore, the final aim of the project is the development of models to classify a sample (e.g. from a patient) to specific groups (e.g. potentially diabetic, Parkinson-like profile, etc.).",,The student considering this thesis proposal must have a strong Bash (command-line) and Python/R knowledge.,microbiome dysbiosis machine-learning personalized-medicine microbiology,No,No,

Identifying the underlying causative DNA variants, especially structural and CNVs, is one major challenge for genetic diagnosis.
Hereditary ataxias consist of a highly clinical and genetically heterogeneous group of rare neurogenetic diseases mainly characterised by motor incoordination deficits. There are at least 16 hereditary ataxia subtypes associated with pathogenic unstable expanded DNA repeats: seven are caused by translated CAG repeat expansion mutations (SCA1-3, SCA6-7, SCA17 and DRPLA); SCA12 and FXTAS, by CAG and CGG repeats located in the 5′ untranslated region respectively; and SCA8 by a toxic antisense-resulted transcript containing a CAG repeat. Six inherited ataxias are caused by intronic trinucleotide repeats (FRDA), pentanucleotide repeats (CANVAS, SCA10, SCA31 and SCA37) or hexanucleotide repeats (SCA36). The remaining known hereditary ataxias are due to conventional mutations such as missense, nonsense, insertions, or deletions.

TRMNs are aggressive clonal hematologic malignancies that occur as a late complication after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and are associated with a very poor prognosis. TRMNs are genetically complex and are often refractory to standard therapy. In addition, cancer patients who have clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) have an increased risk of developing TRMN. Objective: genetic characterization by whole exome sequencing (WES), targeted deep sequencing (TDS) and single cell analysis. Methodology: 50 patients (25 with complex karyotype and 25 with normal karyotype) will be studied prospectively and retrospectively at the time of diagnosis of TRMN by WES. It is expected recover peripheral blood samples from the moment of the primary tumor from approximately 10 of these patients in order to be analyzed by TDS. It is estimated that in 5 of them we will detect CHIP, which will also be analyzed by TDS. To obtain more information regarding the intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution of TRMN, single cell genomic studies will be performed in bone marrow samples from 8 patients with TRMN at two different time points. Expected results: to detect the genetic changes involved in the pathogenesis of TRMN, evaluate their application in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of this group of patients.","SELECTED PAPERS OF OUR GROUP:

It is well established that school performance is an indicator of a future global life success including health, family, and social welfare. However, there is a need for understanding why more than 20% of children have learning difficulties. There is evidence that psychiatric disorders and environmental risk factors have a great impact on school performance. However, it remains unclear the nature of these relationships and the interplay between them.

OBJECTIVES:
We propose a novel comprehensive approach to explore to which extent the genetic background associated with depression and anxiety as well as environmental exposures (demographic, psychosocial or lifestyle factors) impact on school performance outcomes. We will assess the genetic overlap and causal relationship between depression and anxiety and school performance, and will investigate whether these associations are influenced by environmental risk factors in a population-based sample of 6,000 children from primary and secondary schools.

SPECIFIC AIMS:
1.To assess the genetic overlap between depression and anxiety and school performance using genome-wide association studies: (i) to estimate the genetic correlation between traits, (ii) to run a cross-trait analyses to identify common genetic risk factors and (iii) to use polygenic risk scores for the different disorders to predict school performance outcomes.
2.To infer the causal role of depression and anxiety on school performance using Mendelian randomization.
3.To identify environmental exposures (demographic, psychosocial stress or lifestyle factors) associated with poor school performance.
4.To test the degree to which the association between school performance and environmental risk factors (objective3) are modulated by the genetic background associated with depression and anxiety (objective 1) by identifying
gene*environment interactions affecting school performance.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
We will consider high dimensional data and state-of-the art techniques to expand our knowledge of school performance, with the overarching aim to translate findings into predictive and preventive strategies for the benefit of vulnerable students’  groups and to promote population-wide positive development.

Their function is to present short peptides to T-lymphocytes so they can activate an immune response when a pathogenic antigen is detected. Such peptides, called epitopes, can come from diverse pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, but also from cancer cell mutations, referred to as neoantigens.

The prediction of peptide binding affinities to the variable MHC molecules is a crucial feature to assess which epitopes will be able to trigger T-cell recognition and the subsequent immune response. In recent years, many state-of-the-art methods have been developed [1,2] relying mainly on MHC-binding assays data and, more recently, on mass-spectrometry data for their training and validation. However, it has been observed that this data has a high degree of noise-related variability, mainly due to the heterogeneity of its experimental sources, leading to similar peptide-MHC complexes receiving significantly different binding predictions. This can have a huge impact on the generalisability of the predictions since models can be confounded when trained with spurious data. This is particularly relevant for machine learning models, which rely heavily on their training datasets to assess peptide-MHC binding affinities.

To circumvent this, our group recently developed NOAH, a method trained on position-based propensity matrixes that does not require data from MHC binding assays, but known MHC-peptide crystallographic structures. This approach showed a better correlation with epitope immunogenicity than other state-of-the-art MHC binding predictors (1,2). To further expand our structure-based approach, we aim to develop an affinity prediction method based on the exploration of the Protein binding energy landscape of peptide-MHC complexes through exhaustive Monte Carlo sampling. Data derived from this simulations will be first validated by contrasting results against an experimental reference dataset of MHC-binding, collected exclusively from a single laboratory source [3], and, secondly, it will be used in the training of machine learning algorithms to create faster tools for vaccine design and epitope prediction.

What is the content of their genomes? What genes do they express, and how might that impact the function of the community? A prerequisite to answer these questions is to separate assembled metagenomic or metatranscriptomic contigs into bins corresponding to their species of origin. When performed on metagenomic data, the results are labeled “metagenome assembled genomes” (MAGs). Each MAG is presumed to have originated from a single species, and can then be used to analyze gene content and function in a community context, to build phylogenetic trees to identify potential new lineages of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and in other downstream analyses. But “metatranscriptome assembled transcriptomes” do not yet exist, due to a key difference between genomes and transcriptomes. Each cell should have a fixed number of copies of its genome (its ploidy), meaning that the number of sequence reads contributing to the assembly of each part of the genome (also known as coverage) should, on average, be the same. This information, along with nucleotide base composition, is used to divide assembled sequences into bins. But each cell will not have a fixed number of copies of each transcript, because the cell is expected to modulate gene expression in response to internal and external factors. Therefore, existing metagenomic binning tools, which depend on both base composition and coverage, cannot be applied to metatranscriptomes. The objective of this project is to aid in the development and testing of a novel algorithm, based on nucleotide composition alone, to bin metatranscriptomic data sets. There would be numerous applications of such a method, from assembling human gut metatranscriptomes, to separating symbiote from host sequences in holobionts, to the removal of contaminant sequences from standard transcriptomic data sets.","Examples of metagenome sequence binning:

Do their immune systems have roots in their unicellular pasts? One of the main types of antibacterial defense proteins in both plants and animals are the NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat superfamily proteins), which appear to have evolved independently in both animals and plants, from a similar set of protein domains (see Fig. 2 of Richter and Levin, 2019).

Curiously, initial data indicate that NLRs appear to be present in unicellular eukaryotes. Do they function in antibacterial defense in single-celled eukaryotes? The purpose of this project would be to answer this question and explore its biological and evolutionary implications, by searching for candidate NLR proteins across eukaryotic diversity and then building phylogenetic trees to understand their evolution: do NLRs appear to have evolved independently in plants and animals? Or were they present in their common ancestor, and thus deep in eukaryotic evolutionary history, implying a role for antibacterial defense in the early steps of the evolution of eukaryotes?

We will take advantage of the fact that numerous unicellular eukaryotes have had their transcriptomes sequenced in different growth conditions (as part of the MMETSP project; Keeling et al., 2014). We will examine the differential expression of candidate genes, to determine whether they behave as we would expect for antibacterial genes. A subset of MMETSP transcriptome data sets were sequenced in the presence or absence of bacteria (in which we would expect to find differential expression of antibacterial genes), whereas others were sequenced in different media conditions, but without bacteria (which will be a negative control for antibacterial activity). This analysis, involving existing data sets, will provide clues as to whether candidate NLR genes may have antibacterial activity in the unicellular relatives of plants and animals.","Keeling et al., 2014 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001889

High-throughput experiments have a unique capacity to provide large amounts of data that holds the potential to significantly improve our understanding about biological processes. Different open-source repositories are available where researchers in health science upload their data to make them available to the scientific community. As a result, these repositories contain gene and protein expression measures for millions of patients, across various pathologies and conditions. Beside the high-throughput information, the metadata about each sample is usually uploaded, containing information such as the pathology under study, the tissue where the data were obtained, the age of the patient or their ethnicity. Unfortunately, a big percentage of the data available in these databases do not contain information about the age and the ethnicity of the patients. This information, that was probably non-relevant in the experiments performed by the original researcher, might be very relevant when these data are re-used for other analysis purposes.

In this project, we propose to create machine learning models to infer the metadata of the patients included in a large repository containing more than ten thousand samples. Initially, the student will use machine learning strategies based on various regression algorithms to study the relationship between the expression data and the age of the patients. Using an internal tool, the student will identify the best models for predicting the age based on the high-throughput data. In a second phase, the student will apply and test the selected algorithms on the full set of data, with the goal of predicting the missing information about the age. If time allows, a similar pipeline based on classification algorithms will be created for the analyses of the ethnicity data in the same database. Several quality control techniques will be applied in this process. The student will acquire experience with programming, machine learning algorithms and tools and will get hands-on experience with high-throughput data. In case of publication, the student will be included as co-author of the published paper.

The ability of computationally designing proteins from the ground up with no restriction to what is available in nature is radically transforming the protein engineering field, and opens the door to overcome the limitations of natural proteins in biotechnological and medical applications.

To date, approaches to engineering antibodies rely on naturally occurring immunoglobulin backbone frameworks, and mainly focus on optimizing the antigen-binding loops and/or multimeric formats for improving targeting efficiency or biophysical properties. Despite their exponential advance as protein therapeutics, engineered antibodies have significant limitations in terms of stability, manufacturing, size and structure, among others. Towards the de novo design of antibody-like proteins with superior properties, we have recently developed an approach for custom-designing large libraries of immunoglobulin frameworks spanning a wide range of geometries and successfully confirmed the structure of some of these by X-ray crystallography, and were found to be hyperstable [4].

In this project we aim to incorporate antigen-binding loops from antibodies or short peptides binding targets of biomedical interest into our frameworks. We will start grafting loops of known structure and design structured linkers to ease the accommodation of the loops in the frameworks [5]. We will explore different positions of the frameworks that could be functionalized and design variants incorporating one or more binding loops. This may allow us to target either a single epitope through large binding surfaces (monospecifics) or two different epitopes simultaneously (bispecifics).

For designing purposes, we will use the (py)Rosetta modeling suite as a basis for coding the different pipelines. For validation purposes, the breakthrough of deep-learning structure prediction methods like AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold now allows us to make predictions of designed proteins with unprecedented accuracy at a relatively low computational cost. We will use both techniques to confirm in silico that the functionalized proteins fold correctly. We will also perform molecular dynamics simulations to verify that the functional regions bind their targets as expected. Finally, the most promising designs will be experimentally tested and characterized in our lab. Optionally, and if the time allows, the candidate is offered to participate in the experimental testing in our wet-lab division.","[1] Marcos E, Silva DA.

In particular, the identification of allosteric ligand-binding sites for a selective inhibition of protein families with a high similarity has become an attractive approach for many biotech companies. A plethora of approaches have been developed to try to solve this problem being the different molecular dynamics versions those that have obtained the best results. However, the problem is far from being solved. Basically because the potential energy surface (PES) of the ligand-protein system is a continuous function with respect to the coordinates of the nuclei with dimension N=3n, where n is the number of atoms which turns out to be a big number, preventing an easy computational resolution of the problem.   In this project, we will develop a novel method for conformational searching of relevant biological systems that relies upon the fact that it is possible to locate saddle points which surround a given minimum on a complex PES using the concerted atomic motions found in low-frequency vibrational modes.  In a first approximation, the gentlest ascent dynamics in combination with the shrinking dimer method and Newtonian dynamics developed previously [1] will be extended to biological systems and next the method will be coupled with the use of conjugate directions [2] to increase its effectiveness. Different parameters needed in the method, the use of a complete or approximate hessian and other practical questions will be analyzed in deep to generate software able to efficiently explore the conformational space of protein-ligand systems.
In this scenario, the proposed workplan is as follows:
1.Implementation of the shrinking dimer method (SrDM) using both the AMBER python api and the openMM project.
First, the AMBER python api will be used to implement the SrDM because our experience with this software. However, although the programs of the AMBER software needed to do this implementation are free, we will use another free software, the openMM project, where the use of GPUs is more accessible. We will start with a simple system, the alanine dipeptide, a system whose potential energy surface can be described by only two variables [3].
2. Extension to more complex biological systems; In particular, drug-protein complexes of known x-ray structure and energetics. The objective is to answer the basic question: can this method locate de experimental structure starting from a random initial position ?
3. Extension of the previous study to the new method [2] to compare their effectiveness.

Here, we will use a sophisticated food addiction mouse model. In this model, we measure 3 addiction criteria for diagnosing the disease and 4 phenotypic traits suggested as predisposing factors related to vulnerability to addiction. Also, it is possible to evaluate the extended food addiction mouse model with mice genetically modified. We target the endocannabinoid system with specific mutations in the CB1 receptor. Notably, the novelty of this protocol is the adaptation of this food addiction model to a short protocol to evaluate genetic manipulations targeting specific brain circuitries by using a chemogenetic approach that could promote the rapid development of this addictive behavior. These adaptations lead to a short food addiction mouse protocol, in which mice follow the same behavioral procedure of the early period in the long food addiction protocol with some variations due to the surgical viral vector injection. There is no paradigm in mice allowing us to study the combination of such a robust behavioral approach that allows uncovering the neurobiology of food addiction at the brain circuit level. We can study using this protocol if modifying the excitability of a specific brain network confers resilience or vulnerability to developing food addiction. Understanding these neurobiological mechanisms is expected to help find novel and efficient interventions to battle food addiction.","Domingo-Rodriguez L et al.

Metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), the lethal form of this disease, is enriched for DNA damage repair (DDR) alterations that can guide precision medicine indications such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), a novel class of cancer therapy developed based on the principle of synthetic lethality. Inactivating mutations and deletions in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 (key enzymes of a specific DNA repair pathway, homologous recombination (HR), are the most common event leading to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in prostate cancer, but other genomic and post-genomic mechanisms are still not clear. Hence, there is a need to develop biomarkers that can identify which tumors harbor this phenotype that can be relevant for treatment stratification.
HRD tumors develop specific and repetitive genomic alterations due to their impaired DNA repair capacity, leading to a “scar” or signatures in the genome that can help identifying those cases with DDR deficiencies. This approach is based on the principle that the normal function of homologous recombination ensures the error-free repair of double-strand breaks; then, in its absence, specific DNA scars accumulate in the genome. This motivates developing surrogate genomic markers of HRD based on high throughput sequencing from tumoral samples, which imply methods that could be technically complex, time- and data-storage consuming, often need a matched normal sample and can be costly.
Liquid biopsies have emerged as an alternative way to study the tumor genomic landscape in clinical practice, allowing the non-invasive analysis of the evolution of tumor genomes during treatment and disease progression.
Our group has collected longitudinal liquid biopsies from mPC patients as their disease evolves over years. The aim of this project is to develop a bioinformatic framework to identify HRD based on genomic features that could be detected through whole genome sequencing (WGS) at low coverage (shallow WGS) of liquid biopsies from patients with PC.
The Prostate Cancer Translational Research Lab at VHIO is a multidisciplinary team of biomedical scientist including computational biologists, molecular biologists, experts in genomics, clinical researchers and clinical data managers that pursue improving the management of mPC patients through developing precision medicine strategies.

The tiny organisms it contains are crucial for global ecosystem function. For example, microbial phytoplankton in the ocean fix as much carbon from the atmosphere as land plants, and other heterotrophic microbes guarantee that a part of the fixed carbon is circulated through food webs sustaining animal life. In a context of global change, it is fundamental to increase our understanding of marine microbes and how they may be affected by the warming ocean. The genomic machinery of the ocean microbiome has been investigated intensively during the last 15 years thanks to the advent of High Throughput Sequencing. Millions of new genes have been retrieved from the ocean and were connected to metabolisms and genomes. Yet, we still have a poor understanding of the fine-grained genomic variation that is normally associated to populations. These populations may show specific adaptations to different oceanic conditions allowing us to comprehend the action of natural selection and to discover gene variants that may code for proteins featuring functional variation. In addition, we still have a rudimentary comprehension of how that fine variation behaves over time or space, due to selection or drift, leading to evolutionary change. All in all, understanding population genomics and fine evolutionary change are possibly two of the greatest challenges in ocean microbiome research for this decade. The proposed master project aims to 1) determine the population variation of selected ocean microbes (using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms [SNPs]) and 2) find out whether some of the previous variation is due to evolutionary processes that occurred relatively recently in geological time. This project will occur within the project MINIME (Microbial Evolution and population genomics in a changing ocean. PI: Ramiro Logares, financed by the Spanish Research Agency). The project will use short (Illumina) and long read (PacBio) metagenome datasets from two global ocean expeditions (Tara Oceans and Malaspina) as well as monthly metagenomes from two coastal microbial observatories in the Mediterranean Sea over 7 years. In combination, these datasets include Terabytes of genomic data being possibly the best representation we have so far of the diversity and function of marine microbes. We will analyse metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and then map short metagenomic reads from the global ocean or the time-series to a number of selected MAGs of ecological importance. Afterwards, we will perform a SNP calling analysis, aiming to dive into populations genomics. Populations will be determined and we will aim to link them with environmental or geographic features. SNPs analyses will indicate whether part of the detected variation has emerged through adaptive evolution. Most of the work will involve bioinformatics, statistics and machine learning. Analyses will be performed at our marine bioinformatics platform Marbits https://marbits.icm.csic.es as well as at the Finisterrae III supercomputer at CESGA in Galicia via CSIC agreements. This project is well-suited for a motivated student that is up for the challenge to work at the interface between microbiology, metaomics, bioinformatics & oceanography. Work in this project can open future opportunities in other more applied projects within the EU prioritized research area of blue biotech via bioprospecting gene variants of the ocean microbiome that could be used in industry (https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/biotechnology_en). There are possibilities of economical support via the CSIC’s JAE intro programme or via other projects (to be discussed). The project is designed in a way that can be developed in a scenario of Covid19 restrictions. The log-lab has hosted 6 master students from the master in bioinformatics for health sciences in the past and most of them continued with PhD studies either at the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) or abroad or work as bioinformaticians at the ICM-CSIC.

The assembly of microbial genomes from metagenomic datasets using binning strategies allows us to link function and identity. This is crucial if we want to fully understand the role that microbes are playing in the environment. Also, MAGs allow us to unveil the genomic diversity of previously unknown or uncultured organisms from which we don’t have genomes available. MAGs have dramatically increased the known prokaryotic diversity, both bacterial and archaeal, and recently it has been also used to reconstruct microeukaryotic genomes. Despite this approach has been widely used to explore the microbial diversity in certain environments, such as the ocean or the human gut, little has been done in other systems, in particular other host associated environments. There are not that many hosts associated metagenomes available. So, exploring this type of microbial environments using MAGs is not that easy. However, there are many genomes available from animals and plants. There is no way to differentiate the host form its associated microbial communities when we extract the genomic material from a sample. So, when we build a genomic library, we are building it for the targeted multicellular organisms and also for all its associated microbes, sort of a holobiont metagenome. When we assemble the targeted genome, we discard the “contaminants”, usually these contaminants correspond to prokaryotic or microeukaryotic sequences. We use this fraction of “contaminants” and treat them as metagenomes.

The tiny uniflagellated Minorisa minuta stands up as one of the smallest bacterial grazers known to date. It has a worldwide planktonic distribution and accounts for 5% of heterotrophic protists communities in coastal waters. Moreover, it apparently represents the only heterotrophic member within the Chlorarachniophytes, the single photosynthetic lineage within Rhizaria. Chlorarachniophytes are marine amoeboflagellated cercozoans that together with the Euglenophytes represent the two eukaryotic groups that acquired a chloroplast by secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga. The existence of this unpigmented protist could be another evidence indicating that the acquisition of the green chloroplast took place independently in both lineages. Nevertheless, this is not a definitive clue as the absence of chloroplast could also derive from a posterior loss of it. Therefore, the genomic analysis of Minorisa minuta and other basal heterotrophic Chlorarachniophytes retrieved in our study is of primary interest to study the transition to secondary plastid endosymbiosis.",,"Required, experience working with shell, python and/or R.

This high mortality stems from the high resistance to chemotherapy, the very abundant stroma (up to 80% of tumour weight) and the lack of stratification criteria for personalised treatment for a significant subset of patients.

In a collaboration between a computational lab and experts on pancreatic cancer, we are interested in studying the mechanisms of this resistance, based among others on alterations in the protein synthesis machinery, as well as the influence of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs), which compose the majority of this stroma [1]. Recently, using translatome analysis and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) over a cohort of 28 Patient derived Xenografts (PDX) we have identified a novel PDAC subtype based on the activation of the Integrated Stress Response pathways (ISR) in the cancer cells, associated with a strong chemoresistance [2].

This project aims to perform further exploration of this classification through tools used routinely by our computational team like ICA, cell type deconvolution, Transcription Factor Activity analysis or GSEA. The student will have the possibility of comparing our data to  state of the art PDAC datasets, such as the Proteogenomics dataset [3] including Glicoproteomics, Phosphoproteomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics and Genomics for >100 samples. Another aim would be to explore the existence of this same ISR subtype in other cancers, by comparing some cell lines generated in the lab with the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Repository (https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/).

During development, most tissues undergo striking changes in order to develop into functional organs. In this scenario, regulation of gene expression turns out to be essential to determine cell fate and tissue specificity. Over the last decades many histone post-translational modifications have been identified and have been associated to specific chromatin structural states contributing to chromatin compaction, nucleosomes dynamics and transcription (Kouzarides, 2007). Of particular interest is the role of histone modifications and chromatin modifiers in gene regulation, as several histone marks have been correlated with active or silent gene expression. The current consensus in the field is that histone modifications influence the structure of nucleosomes promoting or inhibiting the recruitment of effector proteins, thus instructing directly the gene expression output. However, over the last decade few studies have revealed that transcription may occur in the absence of active marks (Hödl and Basler, 2012; Negre et al., 2011; Pérez-Lluch et al., 2015), changes in gene expression are not always accompanied by changes in histone marks and, in many cases, changes in transcription precede histone modifications (Borde et al., 2009; Borsari et al., 2020). Thus, up to date, whether chromatin modifications have a truly deterministic role in transcriptional regulation or not remains elusive (Morgan and Shilatifard, 2020).
The main objective of this project is to analyze, first, the dynamics of nine histone marks during the development of four tissues (antenna, eye, leg and wing) of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, using ChIP-Seq data generated in our group. Second, to characterize genes associated with histone marks changes. Third, to integrate histone modifications analysis with transcriptional changes. And, finally, to unravel novel epigenetic regulatory functions for histone modifications.
We have designed the following proposal in which:
1) The student will get involved in genomic data exploration, to investigate the dynamics of nine histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H4K20me1) during cell fate commitment and classify genes according to histone modifications profiles.
2) The student will analyze correlation and association of multiple variables with histone marks dynamics regulatory regions, including sequence conservation and transcription factors occupancy.
3) The student will integrate transcriptional profiling to histone modifications analysis.
4) And finally, the student will hypothesize novel roles or epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for the nine histone modifications.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) techniques are powerful tools to gain insights into cellular heterogeneity in tissues and to identify previously unknown cell types. Since the first study published in the field (Tang et al., 2009), there has been an explosion of interest in obtaining high-resolution views of single-cell heterogeneity on a global scale.

In cancer, tumor heterogeneity is a common phenomenon that can occur both within and between tumors, and scRNAseq can be applied to obtain unknown tumor features but also the effects of treatment such as immunotherapy. Phenotyping single cells from the tumor microenvironment (TME) has led to the identification of cancer specific stromal cell states and supported their contribution to tumor progression. Single-cell transcriptomics has critically advanced the understanding of immune cell diversity in the TME by generating high-resolution landscapes of different cancer types. Recently, a single-cell tumor immune atlas has been composed for precision oncology (Nieto et al., 2021).

A typical anaysis of scRNAseq data encompasses a first step to obtain the expression matrices and then some other downstream analyses that include quality control, normalization, dimension reduction, clustering, cell assignment and differential expression analysis (Luecken et al., 2019). Several computational platforms have been proposed for downstream analysis, including Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019) and Scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018).

Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. It allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages (https://www.nextflow.io/). VHIO’s computational facilities operate with Slurm, Docker and Nextflow to optimize the resources and guarantee reproducibility of bioinformatic analyses.

The main objective of this master thesis work will be to identify the key steps of scRNASeq data analysis and develop a pipeline using Nextflow that includes most steps in the analysis, from the alignment of the fasq files to subsequent downstream analyses. Special importance will be given to cell type identification in the context of cancer field and therapy. ","Tang, Fuchou, et al. ""mRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell.""

The candidate will join Alfonso Valencia’s lab (Computational Biology) within the Life Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. The project will focus on the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to improve the prediction of comorbidity relationships using molecular information.

Background

Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions in a patient, affects 50 million people in the European Union [van der Heide., et al 2015], being the prevalence higher in women. As the population ages, the prevalence of multimorbidities increases [Barnett et al., 2012], promoting a higher risk of hospitalizations [Cassell et al., 2018], drug-drug interactions [Correia et al., 2019], worse outcomes [Dugravot et al., 2020], and larger medical expenses [McPhail, 2016]. Comorbidity relations, known as the development of secondary disease in a patient already suffering from a previous one [Feinstein, 1970], has been widely studied by epidemiology [Chen et al., 2015]. In recent years, with the development of Electronic Health Records (EHR), systematic analyses have been conducted to identify the pairs of diseases that co-occur more than expected by chance [Hidalgo et al., 2009 & Jensen et al. 2014].

Previous studies have tried to better understand the molecular bases of such co-occurrences making use of different sources of omic data. Among others, Park et al. found that diseases with shared altered, interacting, or co-expressed genes tend to co-occur more than expected by chance [Park et al., 2009]. Similar results were found by [Lee et al. 2008] and [Menche et al. 2015] showing that diseases with coupled metabolic reactions and diseases whose modules overlap in a protein-protein interaction network tend to significantly co-occur. Finally, our lab has been able to recapitulate from 25% to 46% of the epidemiologically described comorbidities based on differential gene expression profiles’ similarities [Sánchez-Valle et al., 2020 & Urda-Garcia, preprint]. Despite the improvements achieved, all the followed approaches obtained large numbers of false positives, described as those diseases that are not comorbid but exhibit similar molecular profiles.

In recent years, ML techniques have demonstrated their ability to outperform more traditional statistical approaches in many different fields of science, such as computer vision [He et al., 2016], natural language processing [Vaswani et al., 2017] and, more recently, protein structure prediction [Jumper et al., 2021]. This major breakthrough, mainly provided by deep neural networks (DNNs), lies in their ability to find complex interaction patterns in the input data. As a consequence, they can process more raw data and recover relevant features undetectable to other less complex models. ML techniques have also been applied to study the co-occurrence [Hassaine et al., 2020] of prevalent diseases such as epilepsy [Thomas et al., 2021] or Covid-19 disease [Aktar et al., 2021]. However, they focus mainly on the use of EHRs, without taking advantage of available molecular data that potentially could explain the relationships between pairs of comorbid diseases with a common genetic burden.

The selected student will focus on the application of innovative ML techniques to understand and predict comorbidities. To this end, different ML models with increasing complexities will be explored, taking molecular data as input. Furthermore, the student will explore the possibility to include additional well-established biological knowledge available in public repositories to improve the initial predictions.","Aktar, S., Talukder, A., Ahamad, M.M., Kamal, A.H.M., Khan, J.R., Protikuzzaman, M., Hossain, N., Azad, A.K.M., Quinn, J.M.W., Summers, M.A., Liaw, T., Eapen, V., Moni, M.A. Machine Learning Approaches to Identify Patient Comorbidities and Symptoms That Increased Risk of Mortality in COVID-19.

The developing fetus and the pregnant mother are both especially susceptible to exposure to environmental chemicals. Many chemicals can pass through the placenta into the fetus. Exposures during pregnancy may lead to adverse outcomes in both mother and fetus that manifest both early and much later in life.

Most studies of the impact of prenatal exposure have examined a small number of specific chemicals. There is growing interest in examining a larger range of exposures at once. This has led to the concept of measuring the chemical exposome to take a comprehensive and agnostic approach toward assessment of chemical exposures.

Environmental epidemiological studies have identified many associations between exposure to individual chemicals during pregnancy and maternal and offspring health outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Metabolomics systematically profiles metabolites, which are the endogenous small molecule substrates, intermediates, and products of cell metabolism in a biological sample. This comprehensive approach can identify metabolic signatures of chemical exposures that could play a role in disease etiology. Notably, metabolomics has been recognized as an omics technology that may be most closely relevant to disease phenotypes. For example, metabolomic platforms assess clinically applicable indicators, such as steroid hormones and cholesterol. Moreover, the small molecules interrogated by metabolomics approaches include nutrients and their metabolites that are involved in disease pathogenesis in humans and animals. Dramatic metabolic changes take place in pregnancy, including increased protein synthesis from amino acids to enable fetal growth and steroid hormone synthesis to support maintenance of the pregnancy. Therefore, metabolomics is of increasing interest in understanding both the normal physiology and pathology of pregnancy. In genetic studies, metabolomics has been used to suggest mechanisms that may underlie associations with health outcomes in humans.

Application of exposomic and metabolomic technologies together in pregnancy could identify metabolomic signatures of a broad range of exposures that could shed light on potential health effects of these exposure, as well as their underlying mechanisms.
This project will use a unique dataset available through the European Project ATHLETE (https://athleteproject.eu/), led by ISGlobal (campus Mar – PRBB https://www.isglobal.org/en/child-health?inheritRedirect=true), pioneers’ researchers in the field of exposome research (https://www.isglobal.org/exposome-hub). The dataset consists of 1300 mother-child pairs with metabolomics and exposomics data at different time points throughout pregnancy and childhood. The metabolomics data are composed of 1000s of untargeted metabolite features.

Project objectives:
1-	Develop a bioinformatic pipeline in R to extract metabolomic features from the raw high-resolution liquid-chromatography dataset
2-	Prepare an analysis protocol for the association between metabolomics and exposomic data
3-	Prepare a scientific manuscript

The student will learn:
-	How to conduct an epidemiological analysis with advanced statistical tools
-	To work with metabolomics and exposome data, which are highly promising new omics technologies in the post-genomic era in the health sector
-	Write a scientific manuscript

The student will fully integrate the regular team meetings and seminars with opportunities to present their work and get training in epidemiology and statistics.

In fact, the ch1q21 region contains a disproportionate number of genes that are ‘human-specific’ and that have arisen by evolutionary genetic mutations known as segmental duplications (SD) in the last million years. This provides a unique opportunity to assess not only the impact of these genes on 1q21.1 NDD but also to assess their function during human brain development and evolution.
